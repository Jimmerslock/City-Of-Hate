 UNG_council:1 "Ungerdaler Electors' Council"
 UNG_council_desc:1 "The body of the Union known as Ungerdaler Electors' Council is responsible for the most important realm policies."
 UNG_unioncouncil_support_amount:0 "Electors on our side"
 UNG_unioncouncil_support_header:0 "[?UNG.unioncouncil_support] §B/§! [?UNG.unioncouncil_total]"
 UNG_gain_voter_attempt:0 "Attempt to gain voter"
 UNG_law_tier_1:0 "Enact Ewigeverfassung"
 UNG_law_tier_1_desc:0 "Our right to rule may still be questioned due to the lack of a codified law. Enacting Ewigeverfassung - ''The Eternal Constitution'' should be our primary focus and key to our realm integrity."
 UNG_law_tier_2:0 "Adapt Kaiserliche Autarkie"
 UNG_law_tier_2_desc:0 "With some more council support we can attempt to pass the Kaiserliche Autarkie that will, de iure give self-sustainability to freiprinzes. De facto, it will allow us to fuel our own economy creating good opportunities for the local mercantilism to grow."
 UNG_law_tier_3:0 "Legitimize Ungerdaler Ältestenrat"
 UNG_law_tier_3_desc:0 "Council of Elders also known as Ungerdaler Ältestenrat had always been a part of the Union, though never had real political power. By changing that, we can get their support and so achieve the adminstrative dominance we need."
 UNG_law_tier_4:0 "Enforce Gemeinsame Verteidigungspolitik"
 UNG_law_tier_4_desc:0 "The idea of joint warfare had been the matter of discussion since the creation of the Union. Today with the approval of the council it would be possible to push Gemeinsame Verteidigungspolitik law, allowing us to create unified command to prepare for any attack scenario possible."
 UNG_law_tier_5:0 "Enact Kaiserliche Wehrpflicht"
 UNG_law_tier_5_desc:0 "The old days had seen Kaiserliche Wehrpflicht, that due to the discontent council had to dissolve. Now, after regaining great authority and trust of the freiprinzes, we can restore the old Imperial Guard in its full glory."
 UNG_law_tier_6:0 "Adelshäusvereint"
 UNG_law_tier_6_desc:0 "Some may see it impossible, some may tremble hearing about the Ungerdaler plans of Empire unification - while we have a dream to make every freiprinz stand under our very own coat of arms. Although this seems like an utopian idea, we can always try to annex our subjects peacefully by promising our lords all honours in our new Empire, safeguarding old dynasties' glory. \n§RWARNING: This action will greatly increase the world tension! Sovereign nations will turn against us§!"
 UNG_union_influence_sphere_category:0 "§YUnion Influence Sphere§!"
 UNG_union_influence_sphere_category_desc:0 "The Union should always maintain its sphere of influences"
 UNG_checkfreiprinz_WIS:0 "Check §YWistingen§! stance"
 UNG_checkfreiprinz_WIS_desc:0 "It is our duty to collect council votes necessary to push imperial laws. Each freiprinz has a free mind so unless he will owe us a favour, the result of his response may vary on both his political situation and his mood. \n§YIt is recommended to ask for the council support first for the confident support vote§!"
 UNG_getfavour_WIS:0 "Ask §YWistingen§! for the council support"
 UNG_getfavour_WIS_desc:0 "There is a way in which we can ensure always positive vote of an elector - we just need to ask him what he needs and fullfill it in exchange for his council support. While most of freiprinzes will see this as opportunity, few may get angered seeing such practises dishonourable. It's still better than blind stance check though."
 elector.1.t:0 "Emperor is checking our stance"
 elector.1.d:0 "Emperor wants to know if we are supporting him in next voting, or not."
 elector.1.a:0 "Emperor has our vote"
 elector.1.b:0 "We won't accept reforms"
 elector.2.t:0 "Emperor favoured"
 elector.2.d:0 "Freiprinz decided to support Ungerdaler Union in another voting, casting positive vote."
 elector.2.a:0 "Splendid!"
 elector.3.t:0 "Freiprinz goes to opposition"
 elector.3.d:0 "It seems that this freiprinz wants to vote against the will of Emperor. We can't do anything about that now."
 elector.3.a:0 "We will do well without his vote"
 elector.4.t:0 "Emperor offers reward for our vote"
 elector.4.d:0 "Ungerdaler authorities had sent a letter very subtly mentioning that for our support in next voting we could use some of the aid Emperor is willing to give."
 elector.4.a:0 "We also need some of our laws pushed..."
 elector.4.b:0 "Fine investment would be enough"

 elector.5.a:0 "We have a deal"
 elector.5.b:0 "They want power? They won't get it"
 elector.6.t:0 "Demands of investment"
 elector.6.d:0 "The reply letter seems to point at the issue of the low local development. Clearly their authorities want our ''completely selfless'' investment in their industry, as a good exchange for their supportive vote."
 elector.6.a:0 "A good investment in future"
 elector.6.b:0 "We don't have time nor resources for that"
 elector.7.t:0 "Demands of military help"
 elector.7.d:0 "In a majestatic tone, diplomats of the Freiprinz wrote a reply in which His Majesty wants us to develop his military contigent. They will need fresh people and some equipment to form professional army. The Freiprinz writes that only such help could guarantee his vote."
 elector.7.a:0 "Behold, we will make your army great"
 elector.7.b:0 "That sounds cheeky. No way"
 elector.8.t:0 "Freiprinz angered"
 elector.8.d:0 "The angered Freiprinz messenger came to us, citing ancient law he said we are violating the ancient law of the Empire trying to bribe and corrupt. While our guards was ready to imprison him for insulting our mandate, he shown us the letter from his Freiprinz, showing that Freiprinz himself ordered him to insult the Empire. Obviously this means we've angered him so much that he promised to stand against us in council."
 elector.8.a:0 "Those bastards will pay for that!"
 elector.10.t:0 "Ewigeverfassung Law Passed"
 elector.10.d:0 "With a majority of votes required, council led by Ungerdaler has pushed the new law: \n\n''Ewigeverfassung - ''The Eternal Constitution'' will be the primary pillar of the reformed Union.

 elector.11.d:0 "With a majority of votes required, council led by Ungerdaler has pushed the new law: \n\n''Kaiserliche Autarky plan will create the internal market centralized in one place - capital Faustburg. What belongs to Emperor shall belong to Union and vice versa.''"
 elector.11.a:0 "What's good for realm is goos for us, perhaps"
 elector.12.t:0 "Ungerdaler Ältestenrat Passed"
 elector.12.d:0 "With a majority of votes required, council led by Ungerdaler has pushed the new law: \n\n''The Council of Elders will be the legal political group of advisors with the powerful administrative vote.

 elector.12.a:0 "Weren't they Ungerdaler puppets?..."
 elector.13.t:0 "Gemeinsame Verteidigungspolitik Passed"
 elector.13.d:0 "With a majority of votes required, council led by Ungerdaler has pushed the new law: \n\n''The joint policy of the Ungerdaler will require all Freiprintzums generals to attend on defence summit. All manuevers will now be coordinated internally by the Ungerdaler staff while independence of army will be saved.''"
 elector.13.a:0 "Ungerdaler tightens its grip"
 elector.14.t:0 "Kaiserliche Wehrpflicht Passed"
 elector.14.d:0 "With a majority of votes required, council led by Ungerdaler has pushed the new law: \n\n''Ungerdaler demands formation of Imperial Guards elite units. For that purpose, the best veteran soldiers from all Freiprintzums are obliged to join Ungerdaler Imperial elite forces. Together, we will protect The Union.''"
 elector.14.a:0 "Aren't they moving too far?..."
 elector.15.t:0 "Unification?"
 elector.15.d:0 "Today, the council meeting was different than others. Only the most devoted supporters of Ungerdaler policy were invited inside the cabinet, debating about something they were calling ''unification''. \n\n The returning messenger started explaining us that Ungerdaler wants to seize our lands, uniting all houses under one, Ungerdaler realm. In return they promise great riches and permissions to imperial holdings."
 elector.15.a:0 "So be it"
 elector.15.b:0 "Objection! We'll never accept that"
 elector.15.c:0 "It has to stop. We will fight for independence!"
 elector.16.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts annexation"
 elector.16.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] arrived in our court in all his honours, awaiting for the process of unification to start."
 elector.16.a:0 "Excellent"
 elector.17.t:0 "Councilmen Oppose the Shuffle"
 elector.17.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to draw freiprinzen attention away from the recent realm politics, it seems that they grew stronger forming an opposition against our shuffle attempts!"
 elector.17.a:0 "Well, this could end worse"

 UNG_cooldowntip_tt:0 "- You will need to wait until the election has passed or use §YCouncil Reshuffle§! if there are not enough supportive votes to pass any law."
 UNG_councilshuffle:0 "Council Reshuffle"
 UNG_councilshuffle_desc:0 "Sometimes the opposition is too big to enact anything. When that happens, the best thing to do is to force abstain, reconsidering approach to reforms, shuffling the diplomats and enforcing political peace. §YResets all supporting and opposing votes, removing electors' stances.§! \n§RUse with caution! There's always small chance that freiprintzums will aggressively oppose the forced shuffle.§!"
 flag_councilbusy:0 "The council is busy"
