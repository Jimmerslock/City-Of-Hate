### Leader Descriptions ###
 politics_NPC_astrellion_desc:0 "Ulmién Astrellion, last heir to the now-defunct Kingdom of Trifell, has successfully overthrown Arthenon's despotic reign and established the Confederacy of the Northern Plains. He is a fair and just ruler, greatly beloved by the people he liberated."
 politics_NPC_stoutfellow_desc:0 "Jace Stoutfellow has succesfully ousted Ulmién and taken the throne for himself. Greedy and corrupt with a wicked streak, the best that can be said for him is that he is not as bad as Arthenon was."
 politics_GMR_arthenon_desc:0 "Arthenon, the Grand Master, sailed to the Northern Plains from the East, subjugating the many kingdoms, republics and other states of Man there. Now, he leads the Grand Master's Realm, dominating his populace with an iron grip."
 politics_UNG_vlussinger_desc:0 "Hochprinzessin Adalina Vlussinger of Faustburg is the current ruler of the Ungerdaler Union. Having ruled Faustburg for only a single year before being elected Hochprinzessin, Adalina is inexperienced, but not naive. Her sharp eye for talent and excellent skills as a judge of character have helped her greatly along the way."
 politics_UNG_council_desc:0 "The Aristokratischer Rat für Handel und staatliche Angelegenheiten, or A.R.f.H.u.s.A., has taken the reigns of Faustbürger politics from the Hochprinzessin. This loose collection of regional nobles now deliberates on matters of state, with Adalina reduced to a ceremonial role in her own Freiprinztum."
 politics_STA_schwarzenbach_desc:0 "Ferdinand Schwarzenbach, popularly known as the 'Bear of Stahlhof,' has ruled his Freiprinztum with an iron fist for decades. He has always nominally been loyal to Hochprinzessin Adalina, but rumours abound that his armies are preparing for a little more than skirmishes with Ordoria..."
 politics_HLZ_rosenblut_desc:0 "Known throughout the Union as 'the Mad Freiprinz,' Kaspar Rosenblut has always been the runt of the litter. The son to the much-beloved Edmund and younger brother to Gotthard, Kaspar was never meant to rule. Some whisper he has become possessed by a Demon since his studies in far Irenthar..."
 politics_HLZ_beckenbauer_desc:0 "Freiprinz Beckenbauer is a unique figure in Ungerdaler politics - a Freiprinz that voluntarily works to limit his own power. He has actively worked to devolve the powers held by the Freiprinz of Holzbrenn, and frequently spends time among the common populace. Despite the stains on his office left by his predecessor, he is already much beloved."
 politics_HLZ_edlerrat_desc:0 "The Edlerrat oversees the day-to-day running of Holzbrenn - creating and reviewing laws, debating issues, and hearing petitions of the citizenry. They actively work to repair the relationship between the common people and the nobility, and guide Holzbrenn to retake its place as one of the Union's finest."
 politics_HLZ_speidel_desc:0 "A quiet, unassuming man that formerly worked as a clerk in the Carpenter's Guild, Melchior Speidel has found himself at the head of the Libertine faction in Holzbrenn's new Assembly. A firm believer in individual rights and liberties, he is set to guide Holzbrenn into a becoming a bastion of freedom."
 politics_HLZ_katzmann_desc:0 "Originally a humble farmer from Dreihuster, Frau Katzmann was forced to migrate to the city when the harvests failed, along with many other Holzbrenner peasants. Left without aid from the government and seeing the casual violence Elven citizens were subject to, she formed an organization to assist Holzbrenn's downtrodden, Human and Elf alike. Now, her Solidarity League has become a leading faction in Holzbrenner politics."
 politics_HLZ_pressler_desc:0 "The right-hand man of the Mad Freiprinz, Marius Pressler has violently crushed the Kirschenrevolution in Holzbrenn. Though he is not as erratic as Rosenblut was, he more than makes up for this with his sheer ruthlessness."
 politics_ORD_lothinnys:0 "Officially Steward to the King, but in practice ruler of Ordoria, Isvenith Lothinnys is an Elf marked by grief and bitterness. One of High King Inskyllithe's most fanatical supporters, Lothinnys was devastated upon his death at the hands of Union troops, and Ordoria's losses to the upstart Realm to the north only cemented his virulent hatred of Humans. Lathweyne should fear the day it is subject to Lothinnys' tender mercies."
 poltiics_ORD_valinthir:0 "His Royal Highness, High King Galerin Valinthir, has reasserted himself as a force in Ordorian politics. Spurred on by his heir, Larennis, Galerin has reigned in his rabid Steward and put Ordoria back on a more sensible course. The non-Elves of Lathweyne may rest easy - but the Rosites should tremble!"
 politics_ORD_vernythe:0 "A controversial figure in the Temple of the Itheryn, Histarine Vernythe has forced through many reforms to align the Itheryn with Puritan ideals following the Rthaur Revolution. A 'Thylgar,' or 'Preacher,' since he was a young teenager, Vernythe single-handedly whipped the disparate, local philosophies of the Itheryn into one grand temple. His opponents accuse him of bending the philosophy to fit his Puritan agenda, but to many he is the 'Father of the Modern Temple'."
