 GENERIC_dominate_sea:0 "Dominate the Seas"
 GENERIC_dominate_sea_desc:0 "Though our army laments it, the interests of the navy come first. Without them, our trade would grind to a halt and our overseas interests would be laid to waste. The fleet is mightier than the sword."
 GENERIC_officers_curriculum:0 "Set the Curriculum for Officers"
 GENERIC_officers_curriculum_desc:0 "Though we are lucky to have talented generals, this has been due to chance rather than education. We need to decide what strategies suit our armed forces best, and create an Officer's Academy to teach this doctrine."
 GENERIC_trust_cavalry:0 "Trust in Cavalry"

 GENERIC_hammers_anvils:0 "Hammers and Anvils"
 GENERIC_hammers_anvils_desc:0 "Though the cavalry is the core of our army, we must not forget the humble infantryman. Let them hold the line while the cavalry smashes into the enemy's flanks like a thunderbolt."
 GENERIC_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"

 GENERIC_uniforms:0 "Provide Uniforms to Soldiers"
 GENERIC_uniforms_desc:0 "Historically, only officers have worn uniforms in our armies, primarily to look dapper while leading our troops.

 GENERIC_regiments:0 "Regimental Regulations"
 GENERIC_regiments_desc:0 "Soldiers have always been loosely formed up in groups based on where they came from, but we have not yet tapped into the potential benefits this provides.

 GENERIC_levies:0 "Rely on Levies"
 GENERIC_levies_desc:0 "A 'good' army is overrated. A superbly trained soldier will still die if you throw enough louts at him, and giving ten peasants spears is a lot cheaper than training and equipping one professional warrior. Besides, there's plenty more peasants where they came from."
 GENERIC_massproduce_weapons:0 "Mass-Produce Weapons"
 GENERIC_massproduce_weapons_desc:0 "We don't need 'perfect' weapons - you'll find that someone poked with a 'shoddy' spear will still die if the hole in his guts is big enough. We must find as many shortcuts in weapon production as possible - after all, quantity has a quality all of its own."
 GENERIC_supply_wagons:0 "Supply Wagons"
 GENERIC_supply_wagons_desc:0 "Our army is large, and it matters very little if we outnumber the foe by three to one if four-fifths of our army drops dead because of hunger or cold before the battle even begins. We must improve our logistical structures to ensure our troops get the supplies they need."

 GENERIC_chain_command:0 "Forge the Chain of Command"
 GENERIC_chain_command_desc:0 "Our soldiers are drilled to obey every command, no matter how hazardous to their personal safety. In our army, every person knows their place, and our strategies benefit from it."
 GMR_religious_dispute:0 "Settle the Religious Dispute"
 GMR_religious_dispute_desc:0 "There is much religious strife in the Realm - the nobility holds on to Sothrist the faith of our homeland, the Juridity of Benevolence is pushing the belief in Arthenon as a God-King, and the natives still cling to their old faiths. This conflict is destabilizing the Realm, which we cannot afford. We must make a decision on how to move forward."
 GMR_eokgite_orthodoxy:0 "Sothrist Dominance"

 GMR_revise_the_dialects:0 "Revise the Dialects"
 GMR_revise_the_dialects_desc:0 "Though our homeland's religion remains the one true faith, there are several objections in the Dialects that warn of 'dangers' in dealing with Kalafites and Hielites, claiming they 'disturb the balance of nature'. Surely this is a mistake; they carry the blessings of Muzma and Dibegar more than any other."
 GMR_split_church:0 "Split off from the Church"
 GMR_split_church_desc:0 "Our core religious tenets have been shifted, to the point that some within our faith say that we should break away from the cowardly Sothrist Church entirely. The Dasalmids are the holy emissaries of Muzma and Dibegar, and they deserve honouring as such - no matter what the false priests in Eokgi say!"
 GMR_codify_rituals:0 "Codify Rituals of Summoning"
 GMR_codify_rituals_desc:0 "Now that the religious barriers to dealings with Dasalmids have been removed, we should codify standardized Rites of Summoning, to ensure the safe handling of the summoned creatures."
 GMR_encourage_pacts:0 "Encourage Pacts with Dasalmids"
 GMR_encourage_pacts_desc:0 "Kalafites and Hielites can provide powerful boons - be it wisdom, might or courage. We should encourage our generals to make pacts with these holy beings and "
 GMR_forbid_commoners:0 "Bar Plainsmen from the Temples"
 GMR_forbid_commoners_desc:0 "We will never get the natives of the Northern Plains to see the true faith, but that matters not - let them cling to their superstitions! They are not worthy to receive the blessings of the Kalafites and Hielites and should be banned from practicing our faith."
 GMR_underground_churches:0 "Tolerate Underground Churches"
 GMR_underground_churches_desc:0 "We do not want the Plainsmen in our churches, and while we're not going to allow them to openly worship their false gods either, we can turn a blind eye to local religious practices held in secret."
 GMR_religious_detente:0 "Religious Detente"
 GMR_religious_detente_desc:0 ""
 GMR_arthenism_triumphant:0 "Arthenism Triumphant"
 GMR_arthenism_triumphant_desc:0 "The Juridity of Benevolence's arguments for the divinity of the Grand Master have taken hold, and more and more nobles are converting to the Arthenist faith! We should seize this opportunity with both hands and declare Arthenism our state religion."
 GMR_embrace_lorthoris:0 "Embrace Lorthoris"
 GMR_embrace_lorthoris_desc:0 "Though the more zealous of our upper class warn that our gods will destroy us or insist upon Arthenon's divinity, we must keep a level head and embrace the political reality of our situation - if we do not embrace the local faith, we will never truly be accepted as legitimate rulers by the locals."
 GMR_reopen_circles:0 "Reopen the Circles"
 GMR_reopen_circles_desc:0 "During the Unification, we tore down the many religious circles of trees, fungi, or even obelisks, to prevent worhip of local deities. With our embracement of the native religion, we should rebuild and reopen these Circles for service."

He rightfully recognizes that his position is only as secure as it is due to us, and he has offered us full military support against whatever foes we may face. We ought to reply in kind."
 UNG_vassalize_perkavland:0 "Offer Krell a Prinzthron"
 UNG_vassalize_perkavland_desc:0 "Our massive investments in Perkav has given us quite a bit of influence in Krell's Hall, and Krell himself is deeply indebted to us. If we word the proposal carefully, we just might be able to convince Krell to bend the knee and swear fealty to the Hochprinzessin as a new Freiprinz!"
 UNG_end_raids:0 "No More Raids"
 UNG_end_raids_desc:0 "Despite much opposition from those that proposed different solutions, we have forged ahead and once and for all ended the raids from Perkavland! Whatever ships henceforth set sail from Krell's Hall shall be ships of commerce, not ships of war."
 UNG_genius_schlosserhelmer:0 "The Genius of Schlosserhelmer"
 UNG_genius_schlosserhelmer_desc:0 "We have received word of an erratic-yet-brilliant inventor from the humble town of Schlosserhelmer. The Hochprinzessin has taken an interest in this 'Frau Freisler'. We should see if she's interested in Adalina's patronage."

 UNG_all_ungerdaler_academia_desc:0 "Strengthening only the technological prowess of St. Vichtlas and ourselves will not protect the Union against its many foes.

 UNG_industrialize_faustburg:0 "Industrialize Faustburg"

 UNG_geological_surveys_desc:0 "Apparently, Frau Freisler has gone on extensive hikes throughout the countryside. We were about to reprimand her for this, but it turns out she wasn't dodging her responsibilities. Instead, she's been practicing new techniques to find resources hidden in the land - we should exploit them immediately!"
 UNG_refine_irrigation:0 "Refine Irrigation Techniques"
 UNG_refine_irrigation_desc:0 "Frau Freisler's countryside walks have clearly brought back memories of her rural childhood - she has been drawing up plans to improve irrigation of crops. With these methods, we will be able to grow food much more effectively!"
 UNG_holistic_architecture:0 "Holistic Architecture"
 UNG_holistic_architecture_desc:0 "It seems that in her designs for new buildings, Frau Freisler not only considers the materials or the ground she's working with, but how the wider landscape can be integrated and used in the construction process or the final building as well. This idea should become standard practice among our builders!"
 UNG_improvismontage:0 "Improvismontage"
 UNG_improvismontage_desc:0 "Freisler's ability to scrounge together workable equipment from whatever happens to be on hand is legendary, and 'Freislering' has become a popular pastime among our more inventive nobles. This should only be encouraged - such kitbashing can only aid us in lean times!"
 UNG_freislerfressen:0 "Freislerfressen"
 UNG_freislerfressen_desc:0 "Frau Freisler has been experimenting with new forms of smoking, saltying, drying and otherwise keeping food edible on the long term. Her main achievement is compressing the rations issued to our troops through new drying techniques, allowing a soldier to enjoy a hearty stew by just adding a bit water. Naturally, our troops have taken to calling this 'Freisler grub,' but eat it they will."
 UNG_prototype_foundries:0 "Prototyp-Gießereien"
 UNG_prototype_foundries_desc:0 "Frau Freisler has single-handedly kickstarted several gunsmiths, armourers, and foundries solely dedicated to turning her more outlandish ideas into workable prototypes. These 'Prototype-Foundries' deserve the Hochprinzessin's support."
 UNG_explosive_entrenchment:0 "Explosive Entrenchment"
 UNG_explosive_entrenchment_desc:0 "Our generals have long since been fascinated by the military applications of a big barrel of gunpowder, but Frau Freisler has come up with an innovative use for such explosives. By throwing them at the ground, instead of at enemy fortifications, we can create massive trenches very quickly."
 STA_das_stahlheer:0 "Das Stahlheer"
 STA_das_stahlheer_desc:0 "The army of Stahlhof has seen itself grow in numbers and experience as our conflicts with Ordoria continued. It is our primary line of defence against the Elven threat, and we should treat its members with the respect these guardians of the Union are due."
 STA_veterans_of_the_elbenkrieg:0 "Veterans of the Elbenkrieg"
 STA_veterans_of_the_elbenkrieg_desc:0 "The Elf-Wars, a series of border conflicts with our Ordorian neighbours, have produced many warriors experienced at fighting in the less-than-ideal conditions of the Ordorian jungles and our own dense forests. We should organize these veterans into crack squads and drill sergeants to make sure their knowledge does not get lost."
 STA_lessons_of_neureik:0 "Lessons of Neureik"
 STA_lessons_of_neureik_desc:0 "When those damned Republicans stirred up trouble in Neureik again, we marched in to restore order. Besides earning Freiprinz Hassler's loyalty, this has also taught us some very useful tricks about fighting in ubran environments, which may prove... useful, in the near future."
 STA_fate_of_the_adalinatruppen:0 "Fate of the Adalinatruppen"
 STA_fate_of_the_adalinatruppen_desc:0 "Hearing our concerns about the Ordorians on our border, the Hochprinzessin has ever so kindly sent us a sizable detachment of her personal retinue to help defend us. How sweet. It's just a shame the Ordorians aren't the real reason we're building up our army."
 STA_lessons_of_the_restoration_war:0 "Lessons of the Restoration War"
 STA_lessons_of_the_restoration_war_desc:0 "Our men were instrumental in restoring Freiprinz Hassler to the Prinzthron of Neureik, and they have seen first-hand the dangers of Republican mob rule. Let us learn from the military developments of that time and simultaneously use it in our anti-Faustburg propaganda efforts."
 STA_meat_for_the_grinder:0 "Meat for the Grinder"
 STA_meat_for_the_grinder_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate reality that soldiers die in wars. However tragic this is, it does present us with the problem of depleted ranks. We can remedy this by extending conscription, ensuring we always have plenty of meat for the grinder."
 STA_swords_axes_and_maces:0 "Swords, Axes and Maces"
 STA_swords_axes_and_maces_desc:0 "No matter how many men we press into the army, they will be next to useless without at least a sharp piece of metal to poke the enemy with. We must make sure we have access to the best swords, axes and maces in the Union, and enough of them that our troops won't have to squabble over kit."
 STA_every_village_a_weaponsmith:0 "Every Village a Weaponsmith"
 STA_every_village_a_weaponsmith_desc:0 "Having the best weapons is all well and good, but if you've got no arms at all, even a bad weapon is leagues ahead of no weapon at all. By issuing a mandate that every village over fifty people have at least one weaponsmith, we can make sure our people will never want for weaponry."
 STA_propaganda_bombardments:0 "Propaganda Bombardments"
 STA_propaganda_bombardments_desc:0 "Repeated and sustained exposure to the failures of republicanism will be sure to turn the soldiers Adalina has sent us into staunch monarchists. By then convincing them that Schwarzenbach is the only one that can prevent a republican takeover in the Union, they will surely become loyal to our cause."
 STA_scare_the_faustburg_soldiers_into_submission:0 "Campaigns of Fear"
 STA_scare_the_faustburg_soldiers_into_submission_desc:0 "When propaganda doesn't do the trick, then terror surely will. By letting them tour the sites the Neureiker republicans used to control and showing the wanton devastation they caused, we can terrify them into loyalty."
 STA_every_village_a_soldier:0 "Every Village a Soldier"
 STA_every_village_a_soldier_desc:0 "Having enough men is one thing, having plenty is another. By requiring that every village over fifty people send a single person to join our Freiprinz' retinue, we can massively boost the size of our army."
 STA_steelcourt_iron_discipline:0 "Steel Court, Iron Discipline"
 STA_steelcourt_iron_discipline_desc:0 "With the integration of the Faustburg-Soldaten and the expansions of our domestic military capabilities, we have significantly swelled our ranks. Now it is simply a matter of taking these disparate elements and forging them into a sword that shall strike at the heart of Adalina's Union. To achieve this end, we must foster iron discipline within our ranks."
 STA_the_last_march_of_the_faustburgsoldaten:0 "Last March of the Faustburg-Soldaten"
 STA_the_last_march_of_the_faustburgsoldaten_desc:0 "Adalina's troops have been a thorn in our side for too long, nosing around in places they shouldn't be and asking questions we don't want them to have the answer to. If we were to send them on an expedition into Ordorian lands and made sure the Elves 'accidentally' caught wind of it, we could arrange a very convenient tragedy."
 STA_replenish_the_ranks:0 "Replenish the Ranks"
 STA_replenish_the_ranks_desc:0 "Having rid Stahlhof of Adalina's lapdogs has cleared the air nicely, but it also leaves us somewhat understaffed. We'll need to expand recruitment to replace the losses we have so sadly taken. That said, we can't risk drafting too much of our people, lest our economy collapses. Perhaps we should turn to... outside help."
 STA_perkav_plunderers:0 "Perkav Plunderers"
 STA_perkav_plunderers_desc:0 "The warriors of Perkavland have long since had a fearsome reputation among the people of the Union. Even Stahlhof, easily the furthest from their reach, nearly experienced their ravages when Fritzer forces bribed some of these raiders to sack Holzbrenn. They would make for excellent shock troops."
 STA_skaelinger_stalwarts:0 "Skaelinger Stalwarts"
 STA_skaelinger_stalwarts_desc:0 "The stubborn nature of the Dwarves is widely known, and the children of Skaelinger are no exception. We should hire these implacable warriors to form impenetrable shield walls and aid us should we ever fight in mountainous terrain."
 STA_kurgur_killers:0 "Kurgur Killers"
 STA_kurgur_killers_desc:0 "The Kurgur Orcs are terrifying raiders on their wolves, striking and disappearing before the enemy knows what hit them, leaving only death and destruction in their wake. They would make for excellent light cavalry auxilia to our troops."
 STA_snowelven_stalkers:0 "Snow-Elven Stalkers"
 STA_snowelven_stalkers_desc:0 "The Elves of far Lirothlind are known for their refined culture and their graceful movement, moreso than even our Northern neighbours. If we hired them, they would provide excellent reconnaisance, and of course be very useful in cold-weather fighting, considering their frosty homeland."
 STA_bilodyan_brutes:0 "Bilodyan Brutes"
 STA_bilodyan_brutes_desc:0 "Few forces in this world are powerful than an Ogre, and the only place where they live in significant numbers in Bilodya, one of the old Irinthian lands. If we can hire these powerful warriors to fight for us, they would be shock troops to be reckoned with."
 STA_foreign_officers:0 "Foreign Officers"
 STA_foreign_officers_desc:0 "We've already hired foreign expertise for our rank-and-file, so why stop there? We should hire foreign generals to command the troops of their homeland. They would know best how to get the most out of their own people, after all."
 STA_stahlhof_kommando:0 "Stahlhof-Kommando"
 STA_stahlhof_kommando_desc:0 "We couldn't possibly give our entire military over to foreigners! They'd have no loyalty to Stahlhof or Schwarzenbach, only to the coin they are provided. No, we must recruit our officers from our own men. Homegrown loyalty cannot be outdone."
 STA_path_clearer_batallions:0 "Path-Clearer Batallions"
 STA_path_clearer_batallions_desc:0 "Our troops fighting in the Ordorian jungles, with their thick undergrowth and nonexistent pathways, have developed so-called 'Pfadmachtruppen', auxilia battalions that cut and burn away the undergrowth to make a path for our main forces to move through. Given their obvious military use, we should expand the role of the Path-Clearers and grant them a formal position in our military."
 STA_a_convincing_act:0 "A Convincing Act"
 STA_a_convincing_act_desc:0 "Our claims about fighting the Ordorians have been, perhaps, too succesful. We've come under the watchful gaze of the Hochprinzessin, who is expecting to see results sometime soon. We will have to give her some, lest our cover be blown."
 STA_stahlplan_zhertis:0 "Stahlplan Zhertis"
 STA_stahlplan_zhertis_desc:0 "The jungles of Zhertis are rife with Ordorian raiding forces that spend their days roving through our lands. This ends now."
 STA_stahlplan_venoehr:0 "Stahlplan Venöhr"
 STA_stahlplan_venoehr_desc:0 "Venöhr, once a part of the Dwarven empire of Vergallheim, is now in the hands of Ordoria. Some Humans, known as the Perkafell - distant descendants of the Perkav founders of what is now Fritzhafen - still live here. We should protect them from Ordoria's tender mercies."
 STA_stahlplan_anzitt:0 "Stahlplan Anzitt"
 STA_stahlplan_anzitt_desc:0 "Anzitt is one of the border conflicts that we have fought the hardest and bloodiest over. If we were to take it, it would place us in a perfect position to strike at the Ordorian capital, if it came to that."
 STA_stahlplan_fratin:0 "Stahlplan Fratin"
 STA_stahlplan_fratin_desc:0 "Given our expansions, the province of Fratin has ended up in a very vulnerable position for the Ordorians. We might as well pounce on the opportunity and seize it."
 STA_limited_engagement:0 "Limited Engagement"
 STA_limited_engagement_desc:0 "While we will have to be seen clashing with the Ordorians, there's no need to waste soldiers and equipment that we will need against Adalina. As long as we can make an ungodly racket in the jungles, we won't have to actually wage war on the Elves."
 STA_rapid_retreats:0 "Rapid Retreats"
 STA_rapid_retreats_desc:0 "The initial stages of any battle are much about positioning and skirmishes than they are about inflicting harm on our opponents. By engaging in these early parts of battles, then retreating as soon as more serious engagements seem imminent, we can deceive our troops - and, more importantly, Adalina - into thinking we're fighting the Ordorians much more than we actually are."
 STA_much_ado_about_nothing:0 "Much Ado about Nothing"
 STA_much_ado_about_nothing_desc:0 "It seems our theatrics have paid off - so much so, that Adalina herself has sent us smiths and builders to help us expand our military infrastructure. It would be a shame to not put them to good use."
 STA_neuzeit_krieg:0 "Neuzeit-Krieg"
 STA_neuzeit_krieg_desc:0 "Times are changing - the return of magic has already completely altered battlefield tactics, and word of new, devastating weapons from far Maslodan is promising yet further fundamental change. We must be flexible, and ready to adopt any martial advantage we can find."
 STA_uproot_the_old_guard:0 "Uproot the old Guard"
 STA_uproot_the_old_guard_desc:0 "While our generals have served us well for a long time, these old men have grown stubborn and inflexible in their ways. With the ways of warfare changing, we will have to replace them with younger, more adaptable minds."
 STA_introduce_meritocracy_in_the_army:0 "Introduce Meritocracy to the Army"
 STA_introduce_meritocracy_in_the_army_desc:0 "While we would never be as foolish as to introduce these ludicrous notions of democracy and republicanism that have grown so popular in Holzbrenn and Fritzhafen, the concept of meritocracy, where skill instead of birth dictates position, could prove useful in a military context. Let us promote anyone that proves competent in command, instead of reserving these priviliges for the aristocracy."
 STA_meritocratic_autocracy:0 "Meritocratic Autocracy"
 STA_meritocratic_autocracy_desc:0 "Meritocracy has proven to be quite useful in providing us with competent commanders on all levels, but it has also led to soldiers questioning their orders. We must make it clear that just because they once fought besides their officer, that does not give them the right to question or disobey their commands."
 STA_der_stahlschritt:0 "Stahlschritt"
 STA_der_stahlschritt_desc:0 "The 'Stahlschritt', or the 'Steelstep', is a new method of marching invended by Herr Kondor, one of the up-and-coming young officers that worked their way through the ranks. Given its proven increase in marching speed and reduced fatigue it causes in our troops, we should formally incorporate it into our drills as a first strategic success of meritocratic autocracy."
 STA_authority_earned_is_unquestioned:0 "Authority Earned is Unquestioned"
 STA_authority_earned_is_unquestioned_desc:0 "Any man, no matter their station of birth, can reach the very highest ranks in our government, but once they have reached these positions, we expect their orders to be obeyed without question. Our soldiers have more confidence in their commanders, knowing that they have real battlefield experience."
 STA_the_heldenmauer:0 "The Heldenmauer"
 STA_the_heldenmauer_desc:0 "Our army has colloquially become known as the 'Wall of Heroes' - completely impenetrable, every single soldier part of an unyielding wall of daring and heroism. They ought to be celebrated as such."
 STA_heed_the_rank_and_file:0 "Heed the Rank and File"
 STA_heed_the_rank_and_file_desc:0 "With the introduction of meritocracy in our army, our soldiers have been questioning their orders, the structure of the army, and even put forward proposals of their own to improve our army. While this is certainly unorthodox, and we must of course retain order in the ranks, at least listening to such initiatives might greatly boost the morale and loyalty of our soldiers."
 STA_soldiers_pensions:0 "Pensions for Our Troops"
 STA_soldiers_pensions_desc:0 "One of the most common requests of our soldiers is the formal establishment of pensions for those of them that survive their service. Doing this would likely significant boost their willingness to fight. Besides, not so many of them actually survive that this would be a serious strain on the treasury, and having our veterans roam homeless in the streets of Stahlhof is not a good sight."
 STA_witwengeld:0 "Witwengeld"
 STA_witwengeld_desc:0 "Another demand of our troops is the introduction of a Witwengeld, or Widows' money. Knowing that their partners at home will be cared for by the state in the unfortunate event that they fall in battle will doubtlessly lead to greater bravery and sacrifice on the part of our troops."
 STA_first_aid_field_training:0 "First Aid Field Training"
 STA_first_aid_field_training_desc:0 "Teaching our men the basics of field medicine - desinfecting and dressing wounds, removing arrows, splinting broken bones, et cetera - will both greatly increase their chances of survival and show that their Freiprinz genuinely cares about their wellbeing."
 STA_hasslers_prinzthron:0 "Hassler's Prinzthron"
 STA_hasslers_prinzthron_desc:0 "Neureik has been a hive of Republicanism for the past century, and it is only thanks to our timely intervention that Freiprinz Hassler is still in control at all. Even then, his reign is far from stable - he could make a valuable ally, but we would first have to secure his position."
 STA_the_favours_we_are_owed:0 "The Favours we are Owed"
 STA_the_favours_we_are_owed_desc:0 "Now that we have fully secured Freiprinz Hassler's grasp on his lands, it is time to collect on our debts. He owes us a massive favour for all that we have done to aid him, and we should decide how we want it to be repaid."
 STA_alliance_of_equals:0 "Alliance of Equals"
 STA_alliance_of_equals_desc:0 "Hassler might have required our aid, but he is still a Freiprinz, and we should respect him as such - if only because turning him into our loyal vassal would draw the ire of Adalina prematurely and alienate the other Freiprinzen from us when we need them as allies."
 STA_improve_road_networks:0 "Improve Road Networks"
 STA_improve_road_networks_desc:0 "Our last attempts to aid Hassler against the Republican threat were severely hampered by the poor quality of the infrastructure between our lands and theirs. We should co-operate with Neureik to improve the road network between our two capitals."
 STA_the_stahlreik_market:0 "The Stahlreik Market"
 STA_the_stahlreik_market_desc:0 "Our efforts to develop the road network between us and Neureik has had an excellent side-effect - trade between our two realms has blossomed, and our two economies have benefited greatly!"
 STA_push_our_advantage:0 "Push our Advantage"
 STA_push_our_advantage_desc:0 "Militarily and politically, we have Hassler at our complete mercy. To not demand he submit to our rule would be a grave waste of potential. Adalina may sputter and object, but she won't have the guts to step in to stop us."
 STA_integrated_military_command:0 "Integrated Military Command"
 STA_integrated_military_command_desc:0 "With Hassler at our beck and call, his army is practically ours to command. We should formalize our control by hosting his officers at our court during peacetime and conduct large amounts of joint military exercises."
 STA_force_an_iron_fist:0 "Force an Iron Fist"
 STA_force_an_iron_fist_desc:0 "Though they have seen first-hand the dangers of republicanism, Hassler's vassals still clings to their feeble constitutionalist ways. We should remind them that it was Schwarzenbach, and not their precious rights, that saved them from the guillotine, and that ceding some authority to their rightful Freiprinz is in order."
 STA_loyalty_through_fear:0 "Loyalty Through Fear"
 STA_loyalty_through_fear_desc:0 "Those who speak of love are naive and idealistic. Fear and force are at the heart of politics, and it would be foolish to ignore this simple fact. "
 STA_sidestep_hatred:0 "Sidestep Hatred"
 STA_sidestep_hatred_desc:0 "It is important to be feared, but it is even more crucial to not be hated. By finding unpopular scapegoats, providing constant justifications for our actions and keeping the most brutal of our punishments out of the public eye, we can avoid Freiprinz Schwarzenbach from becoming loathed by his own people."
 STA_loyalty_through_love:0 "Loyalty Through Love"
 STA_loyalty_through_love_desc:0 "Those who speak of fear are misguided and cynical. The use of force has its place in politics, but if we were to only ever use violence and intimidation to get our way, we would be no better than Rosenblut, not to mention overthrown within a week."
 STA_authoritarian_benefactor:0 "Authoritarian Benefactor"
 STA_authoritarian_benefactor_desc:0 "Our Freiprinz' free hand in politics is not to be mistaken for the tyranny of other nations. He is the absolute ruler, yes, but he only uses this power in the interest of our people. Ferdinand is the father of the realm, and should be respected as such."
 STA_the_carrot_and_the_stick:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 STA_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "Relying only on fear breeds hate, while relying only on love breeds disrespect. In order to cement our Freiprinz' power, we must show kindness to those that serve, and no mercy to those that do not."
 STA_war_games:0 "Host the 887 Kriegsspiele"
 STA_war_games_desc:0 "In 877, Stahlhof was granted the prestigous honour of hosting the next decennial Kriegsspiele, a massive series of tournaments, melees, and mock battles. It will be greatly edcucational and boost our international prestige - not to mention the fact that it gives us plenty of room for 'tragic accidents' to occur to our enemies."
 STA_trial_by_fire:0 "Trial by Fire"
 STA_trial_by_fire_desc:0 "Though our army has distinguished itself during the Kriegsspiele, and has been blooded against the Elves of Ordoria, they are unproven against fellow Ungerdaler troops. If we were to engage in a small-scale conflict with a fellow Freiprinztum, we would gain invaluable strategic information for when we finally launch our war against Adalina.

 STA_turn_to_the_caravaneers_desc:0 "An army without an economy to sustain it is nothing. The Guild of Merchants, Caravaneers and Traders is one of our most powerful economic institutions - we should reach out with them and see if we can get them to align more closely with Schwarzenbach's wishes."

 STA_demand_an_embargo_desc:0 "With the Caravaneers firmly on our side, we can demand they cease all trade with Faustburg, instead going through Nochwald or Fritzhafen directly. While this won't be a popular measure, it is sure to hamper Adalina's attempts to build an army to match ours."

 STA_the_merchants_of_fritzhafen_desc:0 "Traders go to many places, and the Caravaneers are no exception. Fritzhafen, the centre of the Union's Eastern trade, holds many offices of our merchants. Perhaps, through these connections, we can seek common cause with them?"

Schwarzenbach will seize destiny by the throat and force it into a shape of his own choosing."

 STA_the_favour_of_the_seven_desc:0 "By publicly demonstrating his piety - and generous donations to the Church, of course - Schwarzenbach can demonstrate his piety. Such wisely-guided rule is sure to draw the favour of the Seven - and, more materially, the Temple League!"
 STA_divine_right_to_rule:0 "Divine Right to Rule"
 STA_divine_right_to_rule_desc:0 "Religion has always been one of the most traditional ways to legitimize rule, and we would should use it too! It would be foolish not to stress that Schwarzenbach is not in his place as ruler of Stahlhof by force of arms, but by a mandate from the Seven itself."

However, despite still wielding great prestige and sway among the anti-Schwarzenbach factions of the Stahlhoffer aristocracy, their material wealth and power has waned significantly.

 FPT_commemorate_saint_desc:0 "The holy St. Vichtlas was such an inspiring figure that an entire Freiprinztum was named after him. When Hochprinz Hamerfeldt allowed Daskellin to join the pantheon, St. Vichtlas prevented widespread outrage by formalizing the loose collection of folk deities and local myths into the official canon of the Septist Church.

 FPT_demand_apologies_desc:0 "Sure, the Vichtlites have 'forgiven' the thousands of dead they have left in our wake, but frankly, they weren't the ones in need of forgiveness.

 FPT_church_too_corrupt_desc:0 "While the Seven are righteous and infallible, their Earthly messengers are clearly not.

 FPT_uniform_polearm_lengths:0 "Uniform Polearm Lengths"
 FPT_uniform_polearm_lengths_desc:0 "Currently, polearm lengths are set by individual smithies, if they are even standardized at all.

 FPT_repeal_zwergenzoll_desc:0 "The Zwergenzoll ('Dwarf-Toll') is the popular name for the 7% tariff on Fireforge steel imposed after the Third Succession Crisis. While nowhere as high as the 23% originally demanded by Freiprinz Hörlemayer of Nochwald back in the day, it's still a damper on trade.

 ORD_peace_with_skaelinger_desc:0 "Though we would love to crush the cockroaches of Skaelinger underneath our boot, we have to prioritise restoring internal stability. Let's see if the dwarves are interested in a peace, for now."
 ORD_end_the_stronghold:0 "End the Stronghold"
 ORD_end_the_stronghold_desc:0 "Those of our men with Traditionalists beliefs could not be stopped from attacking the dwarves if we wanted to, and even the Moderates are concerned about leaving a well-defended hostile nation on our Eastern border. Let us push onward and end the Skaelinger threat once and for all."
 ORD_dominance:0 "Re-Establish Dominance"
 ORD_dominance_desc:0 "The Rosites have been crushed, their precious red banner in tatters. We are currently still treating this as a military occupation, when it in truth is nothing but the restoration of the legitimate government. Let us make sure our re-acquainted Eastern subjects know this as well."
 ORD_duchy_eastern_ordoria:0 "Establish the Duchy of Eastern Ordoria"
 ORD_duchy_eastern_ordoria_desc:0 "Even though their governmental institutions have been toppled, the Eastern rebellious spirit is too strong to break without unacceptable casaulty levels. Let us give them a limited amount of autonomy, so they won't try to break away from us again."

 ORD_direct_rule_desc:0 "Race traitors cannot be given any liberties, or they will go running to their dwarven friends again. We will end the military occupation, but we shall recruit town guards form local loyalists and the most dedicated of our Eastern citizens, to make sure the former rebels don't get any ideas."
 ORD_wars:0 "Oil the War Machine"
 ORD_wars_desc:0 "With our domestic situation secured, we can now look outwards, beyond our borders. Beyond our borders for now, at least..."
 ORD_military_academy:0 "Build the Vuid Officer's Academy"
 ORD_military_academy_desc:0 "We have plans to build a new military academy. Vuid, located very close to rebel-held territory, is a perfect location for such an institution; it allows for first-hand experience, and the presence of loyalist military forces might quell some of the pro-rebel sentiments..."
 ORD_elven_bows:0 "Elven Bows"
 ORD_elven_bows_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us that the inferior vermin of the North and South fear our archers, claiming that their bows are supernaturally accurate and powerful. While this is currently just a result of our keen Elven senses and experienced archers, developing such bows seems like an excellent idea."
 ORD_export_death:0 "Export Death"
 ORD_export_death_desc:0 "We have good soldiers and good weapons, but that matters little if we do not have good leaders. We must make sure the Vuid Academy emphasizes teaching aggressive doctrines to our future generals."
 ORD_mobile_warfare:0 "Adopt Mobility"
 ORD_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "We must strike furiously and never relent in the attack. It is of paramount importance that our forces are mobile, and ready to seize the initiative and exploit any advantages that show themselves, at any time."
 ORD_elven_horses:0 "Elf-Bred Horses"
 ORD_elven_horses_desc:0 "As our knights are perfectly pure beings of grace and power, so too must we only accept the finest of steeds. Let us institute a breeding program, so that we can give our mounted paragons the horses they deserve."

 ORD_provoke_realm:0 "Provoke the Realm"
 ORD_provoke_realm_desc:0 "Arthenon's little Realm has established itself quickly, with the aid of demonic magic, but it matters not. We will send some saboteurs into their land to divert attention from our main attack."
 ORD_seize_sothane:0 "Seize Sothane"
 ORD_seize_sothane_desc:0 "The tiny Duchy of Sothane, though of little economic value, is within spitting distance of the city of Cortineal, and is sparsely defended to boot. We'll send in some troops to take it as a staging post for our full invasion."

 ORD_secure_beachhead_long:0 "We are the undisputed masters of Latherin, and the rest of the nations on our side of the world will sooner or later fall to us. There are, however, still parts of the world out of our reach, firmly in the grasp of the vermin. This must be rectified immediately."
 ORD_long_game:0 "The Long Game"
 ORD_long_game_desc:0 "We are elves, our lifespan is measured in millenia. Time is on our side, so why rush things? Our domination of the world is inevitable, and we can afford to take all the time we need."
 ORD_destabilize_north:0 "Destabilize the North"
 ORD_destabilize_north_desc:0 "Though Arthenon's rule seems absolute, his regime is both foreign and young, and there are plenty of rebels still. It would do us well to support them, and hopefully fracture the Realm into weaker, squabbling, states."
 ORD_support_rebels:0 "Support the Kingsmen Rebels"
 ORD_support_rebels_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that a jumped-up, half-blooded mongrel peasant from Nastrogdar, Ulmién Astrellion, has amassed quite the army in a bid to seize the Blacksteel Throne. Apparently, the primitive gods of the local humans supposedly told him to 'free the Northern Plains from Arthenon's oppression'. Aiding him in staking this claim would surely weaken whoever comes out on top..."
 ORD_support_stoufellow:0 "Support Stoutfellow's Coup"
 ORD_support_stoufellow_desc:0 "Though Astrellion's revolt did indeed weaken the Realm, it seems we did too well - he's proven to be an extremely capable leader and has put the Men of the North on the path to a golden age. Fortunately, one of his confidants is an incompetent bellend with ambitions - it would do us well to put him on the throne instead."
 ORD_support_separatists:0 "Support the Separatists"
 ORD_support_separatists_desc:0 "We don't want to replace one Grand Master with another, we want to shatter the Realm entirely. Though putting an incompetent enough buffoon on the Blacksteel Throne could shatter the Realm without us lifting a finger, it would suit us better to simply support separatist causes."
 ORD_direct_intervention:0 "Direct Intervention"
 ORD_direct_intervention_desc:0 "Though we've managed to kick off at least some separatist revolts, Arthenon is still clinging to power. We need to ensure a total victory for the separatists."
 ORD_sweep_remains:0 "Sweep up the Remains"
 ORD_sweep_remains_desc:0 "We have successfully brought ruin to the Grand Master's Realm, that once proud empire now reduced to pathetically weak city-states. It is time to wander in and claim what is ours."
 ORD_destabilize_south:0 "Destabilize the South"
 ORD_destabilize_south_desc:0 "The Freiprinzen are already continually at each other's throat, and destabilizing the Union further would take very little. A few choice assassinations would aid our cause greatly."
 ORD_stahlhof_gambit:0 "The Stahlhof Gambit"
 ORD_stahlhof_gambit_desc:0 "Stahlhof's leader is an ambitious man, and rumour has it the army's he's supposedly gathering to fight us is in fact meant to take the Freithron from the current Hochprinzessin. If we promise Schwarzenbach the throne of the Union, he might just be persuaded to switch sides..."
 ORD_divide_princes:0 "Divide the Princes"

 ORD_shatter_union:0 "Shatter the Union"

 ORD_compensate_industry:0 "Compensate for our Lost Industry"

 ORD_foreign_labour:0 "Exploit Foreign Labour"
 ORD_foreign_labour_desc:0 "Though we shall allow some demi-Elves to stay in our great nation, they will have to prove their worth to us. If they want to live here, they need to earn it."
 ORD_right_tool:0 "The Right Tool for the Job"
 ORD_right_tool_desc:0 "You wouldn't use a pickaxe to cut down a tree, so why should we use a Human to mine ore when a perfectly good Dwarf is able and willing to do the job? By exploiting the strengths of each race, we can significantly increase the efficiency of our economy."
 ORD_limited_trade:0 "Limited Trade"
 ORD_limited_trade_desc:0 "Though we historically have relied on our own resources as much as possible, this is simply no longer feasible. We must utilize our demi-Elven communities to establish limited trade ties with the outside world."
 ORD_enslave_vermin:0 "Enslave the Vermin"
 ORD_enslave_vermin_desc:0 "Though we long for the day where the world is purified of the vermin, for now, we can make use of them. We do not want our pure-blood kin wasting away in dank mines and in the fields, but the vermin are perfect for the task, and there's plenty more where they came from. If they work themselves to death providing us with resources, they'll be of at least some use for their superiors."
 ORD_free_purebloods:0 "Free the Purebloods"
 ORD_free_purebloods_desc:0 "Now that we have got the vermin into the mines, it's time to get our pure-blooded kin out. Members of our race should not have to endure such circumstances if there's lesser species to do it for them. This will also free up skilled workers for our industrialization programs."
 ORD_industrialization_programs:0 "Industrialization Programs"
 ORD_industrialization_programs_desc:0 "Now that we have expanded our pools of slaves and skilled workers, it's time to put both to use. Double the mining quotas! Draw up the plans! We shall usher in an age of steam and progress for all Elves to enjoy!"
 ORD_recovered_industry:0 "Recovered Industry"
 ORD_recovered_industry_desc:0 "We have made up for our industrial deficit caused by the rebels in the East, and our citizenry can once again enjoy a pre-rebellion standard of living! Let all Elves enjoy our shared prosperity!"
 ORD_elven_labour:0 "Elven Labour"
 ORD_elven_labour_desc:0 "We must not let our soil, our resources, our very nation, be tainted by the touch of the lesser species. We must rely on Elven brain and Elven brawn alone, and with those ingredients we shall build a paradise."
 ORD_elven_wits:0 "Elven Wits"
 ORD_elven_wits_desc:0 "Now that we have the industrial base we need to fuel our war machine, it is time to put our brightest minds to the pursuit of ever deadlier weapons for our soldiers and make up with machines what we lack in elfpower."
 ORD_elven_might:0 "Elven Might"
 ORD_elven_might_desc:0 "The omens were right! With Elven toil and Elven brains have we built a war machine the envy of the world - soon, it shall conquer the world for Elves to enjoy."
 ORD_militarized_economy:0 "Militarized Economy"
 ORD_militarized_economy_desc:0 "Though some complain about our lack of civilian industry, they are fools. We have taken the opportunity granted to us by the lowered standard of living to encourage an austere lifestyle, saving resources for the army. We shall have plenty when our armies have taken over the world, and what's a decade of hardship to an Elf?"
 ORD_university_varinthia:0 "Found the University of Varinthia"
 ORD_university_varinthia_desc:0 "Now that our economic situation has been sorted out, it is time to expand our seats of learning. Varinthia's central location makes it a prime candidate for a new university."
 ORD_future_of_foreigners:0 "Future of the Foreigners"
 ORD_future_of_foreigners_desc:0 "One of the top points of contention during the Autumn Debate was the future of the non-Elves in our country. Unsurprisingly, their community leaders have quite vocally supported the Moderate position, but their fate still balances on a knife's edge."
 ORD_second_class_citizenry:0 "Second-Class Citizenship"
 ORD_second_class_citizenry_desc:0 "Though Ordoria must of course remain a nation for Elves first and foremost, some demi-Elves have proven their worth and should be allowed residence. While this might cause them to bring their own political ideas into our nation, it is sure to garner support for the government from these people as well."
 ORD_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
 ORD_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "It appears communities have formed amongst the demi-Elves. Though our Traditionalist and Faithful rivals cry out for these to be destroyed, we believe they can be of use to us - if handled properly."
 ORD_promote_hofmeyer:0 "Promote Hofmeyer"
 ORD_promote_hofmeyer_desc:0 "The Human Hofmeyer has shown to be extremely good at his work, even by Elven standards, and his loyalty to Ordoria is beyond question. Even though he is not an Elf, he should be appointed Governor of Ythelmare."
 ORD_fuck_hofmeyer:0 "Put Hofmeyer Back in His Place"
 ORD_fuck_hofmeyer_desc:0 "Hofmeyer has advanced as far as any non-Elf is able to and then some, and yet he has the audacity to ask for more. He must be made an example of. The non-Elves must remember their place."
 ORD_segregated_society:0 "Segregated Society"
 ORD_segregated_society_desc:0 "Though we allow demi-Elves to live and work in our nation, they are second-class citizens. Ordoria is a country for Elves first!"
 ORD_deverminize_cities:0 "De-Verminization of the Cities"

 ORD_pure_society:0 "Pure Society"
 ORD_pure_society_desc:0 "Though we have some of the vermin as beasts of burden in our mines and fields, doing the heavy labour on which Elven perfection would be wasted, all respectable parts of society have been scrubbed clean of their filth."
 ORD_create_inquisition:0 "Create the Inquisition"
 ORD_create_inquisition_desc:0 "It is our holy mission, bestowed upon us by the Seven, to cleanse the world of the vermin, no matter where they hide. Let us create a paramilitary wing of the Church tasked with hunting down every last piece of sub-Elven filth."
 ORD_hunt_heretics:0 "Hunt Heretics"
 ORD_hunt_heretics_desc:0 "Though the divine righteousness of our cause is clear, there are those among us that would betray our holy principles and stand by the vermin. They, too, must be removed from this planet as the affronts to the Gods that they are."
 ORD_conclave_tolerate:0 "Tolerate the Moderates"
 ORD_conclave_tolerate_desc:0 "They may be deluded and foolish Elves, but the Moderates are Elves nonetheless. They surely have a place in the great designs of the Seven, and it is not for us to meddle with them."
 ORD_conclave_heretical:0 "Declare the Moderates Heretical"
 ORD_conclave_heretical_desc:0 "The Moderate faction spits on the sacrosanct Elven ideal and disrespect the core tenets of our holy Church. Kill them all and let the Seven sort them out."

 ORD_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand the Ythelmare Shipyards"

 ORD_more_navy:0 "Further Naval Development"
 ORD_more_navy_desc:0 "Our naval capacity has been improved, but not to the extent that we need. Direct more resources to the development of our naval industry."
 ORD_more_port:0 "Expand the Port Network"
 ORD_more_port_desc:0 "Though our navy is now up to snuff, the infrastructure to support it is not. We must construct more ports and develop the ones we already have."
 ORD_safe_port:0 "Safe Havens"
 ORD_safe_port_desc:0 "We have enough ports, but they are difficult to defend in the case of an enemy invasion. Our navy needs its bases, and we must make sure they shall be able to keep them."
 ORD_sponsor_privateers:0 "Sponsor Privateers"
 ORD_sponsor_privateers_desc:0 "We do not have enough resources to build a navy to rival that of the Union or the Realm without fatally weakening our army, but we have plenty of young nobles and rogue captains willing to do our work for us. All they need is our word."
 ORD_coast_raids:0 "Authorize Coastal Raids"
 ORD_coast_raids_desc:0 "Though our privateers have been content with the spoils of ships, those treasures are nothing compared to the wealth found in port cities. We must authorise coastal raids to exploit these riches."

 ORD_sink_ships:0 "Harass the Merchant Ships"
 ORD_sink_ships_desc:0 "Much trade goes on between the Union and the Realm, primarily overseas. Though we do not have the numbers to end this completely, our navy is very well suited to raiding and sinking individual convoys."
 HLZ_mad_prince:0 "The Mad Prince"
 HLZ_mad_prince_desc:0 "Our country suffers under the tyrannical yoke of the Mad Prince, Freiprinz Kaspar Rosenblut. His actions have caused great suffering, and it is unlikely the people of Holzbrenn will put up with it for much longer..."
 HLZ_carpenter_strike:0 "The Carpenter's Strike"
 HLZ_carpenter_strike_desc:0 "The unrest in the Princedom has reached a boiling point - the people of the capital's Woodworking District have taken to the streets in protest! As our country's economy primarily relies on the export of wooden furniture, this is a disaster!"
 HLZ_last_straw:0 "The Last Straw"
 HLZ_last_straw_desc:0 "If Rosenblut's brutal suppression of the Carpenter's Strike wouldn't have caused the entire country to revolt, his unjust mass executions of those involved certainly did the trick. Across the country, from the poorest hovel to the most opulent mansion, cries of defiance are ringing proudly in the night - Down with the Freiprinz! End the Reign!"
 HLZ_nobility_steps_in:0 "The Nobility Steps In"
 HLZ_nobility_steps_in_desc:0 "Appalled by Rosenblut's actions, the nobles of the country have levied their troops and marched on the capital. Holzbrenn and his cronies have fled the Princedom, and envoys have already been sent to Hochprinzessin to explain the situation. The Mad Prince's reign has come to an end!"
 HLZ_never_another_tyrant:0 "Never Another Tyrant"
 HLZ_never_another_tyrant_desc:0 "The nobility of Holzbrenn has resolved to never again allow a Hochprinz to wield the power Rosenblut had, to prevent a second Mad Prince. To satisfy the requirements of the Union, the Council of Dukes shall crown one of their own as nominal Hochprinz, but all power shall rest in the hands of the Council of Dukes."
 HLZ_among_masses:0 "Among the Masses"
 HLZ_among_masses_desc:0 "Despite it being the aristocracy who liberated the country from the reign of Rosenblut, many of the lower classes still distrust the aristocracy, seeing them as complicit in the Mad Prince's excesses. The Council has conceded that this might be a reasonable concern, and has ordered all loyal nobles to spend time amongst their subjects in order to gain their trust and improve the nobility's reputation."
 HLZ_gutprinz_prinzip:0 "The Gutprinz-Prinzip"
 HLZ_gutprinz_prinzip_desc:0 "Though the nobility has recognized the need for a Freiprinz, they are hesitant to give him as free a hand as Rosenblut had. To this end, we have instituted the Goodprince-Principle: if the nobility, or even the common folk, deem a Prince to be unfit to rule, it is their right - nay, their duty - to overthrow them."
 HLZ_limit_princely_power:0 "Limit Princely Power"
 HLZ_limit_princely_power_desc:0 "Having been elected Freiprinz, Konrad Beckenbauer has drafted a bill that would severely limit his own power and submitted it to the Council of Dukes for review. Passing this act would place great safeguards on our fledgeling system."

 HLZ_aristocrats_in_soup_kitchens_desc:0 "Some of the younger members of the nobility have taken to setting up and even working in soup kitchens for the poor, in an effort to reach out to the common folk. The Council should encourage similar initiatives across the country."
 HLZ_assuage_worries:0 "Assuage Worries"
 HLZ_assuage_worries_desc:0 "Despite our newly implemented safeguards against tyranny, many of the common folk and even some nobles express concern about still having a Prince. Freiprinz Konrad has decided to speak to the people in person and convince them that there is nothing to worry about."
 HLZ_feed_people:0 "Ration Foodstuffs"
 HLZ_feed_people_desc:0 "Rosenblut has been intentionally starving the people while throwing lavish banquets for his followers, and we must address this situation at once. Massive relief projects have been started to remedy immediate starvation, and long-term plans to increase food production to a satisfactory level are in the making, but we must deal with the acute problems of famine by rationing what we have."
 HLZ_repurpose_mansions:0 "Repurpose Mansions"
 HLZ_repurpose_mansions_desc:0 "It seems our efforts to let aristocracy and peasantry mix has produced an unexpected side-effect: seeing the plight of the common folk, many nobles have gone to great lengths to improve the lives of their subjects. Some have even converted their mansions into homes for multiple families, hospitals, or schools. The Council must support such endeavours."
 HLZ_repurpose_altpalast:0 "Repurpose the Altpalast"
 HLZ_repurpose_altpalast_desc:0 "Though traditionally, the Freiprinzen have lived in the Old Palace, it still bears the taint of Rosenblut's tyranny. Let us turn this house of grief into a house of hope - an orphanage? A poorhouse? A school? Why not all three? It's big enough."
 HLZ_renovierungsprogramm:0 "The Renovierungsprogramm"
 HLZ_renovierungsprogramm_desc:0 "Though the efforts by some of our aristocrats to turn their mansions into houses for the public are commendable, we cannot rely on such measures alone. We must initiate a bold plan to renovate the slums of Holzbrenn and expand our rural towns."

 HLZ_rehabilitate_altpalast_desc:0 "Though the Altpalast is tainted by association with Rosenblut, it is the only building that could house our new Council of Aristocrats. We must scrub it clean of every reminder of the Mad Freiprinz, and turn it into a symbol of justice and righteous governance."
 HLZ_adelshauser:0 "Adelshäuser"
 HLZ_adelshauser_desc:0 "We have done much, but there are still many of our subjects living in inadequate housing. To tackle this, the Edlerrate has authorized the counstruction of 'Adelshäuser', or Noble's Houses - well-built houses sponsored by the local nobility."
 HLZ_open_universities:0 "Open the University"
 HLZ_open_universities_desc:0 "Under the yoke of Rosenblut, the University of Holzbrenn was little more than a propaganda house, open only to the nobility. It is time we restore its status as house of learning, and allow anyone so inclined to study there."
 HLZ_patronage_brightest:0 "Patronage for the Brightest"
 HLZ_patronage_brightest_desc:0 "The University require our backing, but it cannot handle half of Holzbrenn flooding in at once. By scouring the land and selecting the best and brightest - no matter their social position - for enrolment, we can be sure that the University can handle the influx of new students, while giving opportunities for advancement to everyone in the Freiprinztum."
 HLZ_judicial_institutions:0 "Re-Establish Judicial Institutions"

 HLZ_lords_arbiters:0 "Lords as Arbiters"
 HLZ_lords_arbiters_desc:0 "For centuries, the nobility has been the final arbiter on legal matters on their own lands, and it worked fine before Rosenblut came along. Why fix what isn't broken?"
 HLZ_institutionalize_petitions:0 "Institutionalize Petitions"
 HLZ_institutionalize_petitions_desc:0 "The practice of petitions, where common folk visit the local aristocrat's court to seek a settlement of disputes or compensation for grievances, has allowed the peasantry to voice protests without resorting to torches and pitchforks. We should formalize and strengthen this practice."
 HLZ_rule_nobility:0 "The Rule of Nobility"
 HLZ_rule_nobility_desc:0 "With the restoration of ancient legal traditions, order has returned to our society. Our people trust in their local nobility to pass judgement with the wisdom of their social class, and all feel safe once more."
 HLZ_freiprinzliche_richter:0 "Freiprinzliche Richter"
 HLZ_freiprinzliche_richter_desc:0 "The system of local nobility functioning as judge is far too reliant on individuals being competent and just. We must instead build an independent legal system, with judgement passed based on law, rather than an aristocrat's opinion."
 HLZ_establish_rechtsakademie:0 "Establish the Rechtsakademie"

 HLZ_rule_law:0 "The Rule of Law"
 HLZ_rule_law_desc:0 "Our courts have been depoliticized, and the judge has taken the place of the noble in passing judgement on criminals and legal disputes. Our people trust the system to fairly uphold the law, and no one is above it."
 HLZ_relegitimization:0 "Relegitimize Blue Blood"
 HLZ_relegitimization_desc:0 "The nobility is tainted by association with Rosenblut, and popular support for the noble houses remains low. We must reverse these unfortunate developments and restore trust in the feudal system, before the Republicans or the Rosites come knocking."
 HLZ_relegitimization_institutions:0 "Relegitimization through Institutions"
 HLZ_relegitimization_institutions_desc:0 "Most of our institutions, the Church in particular, are very supportive of the feudal system, as they derive a significant part of their power from it. We should use this to our advantage."
 HLZ_appeal_church:0 "Appeal to the Church"
 HLZ_appeal_church_desc:0 "Many of our people hold the Church in the highest regard. By requesting the canonization of the ancestors of prominent noble families, encouraging pro-state messages in sermons and other such actions, we can use piety to shore up support for the state."
 HLZ_concessions_clergy:0 "Concessions to the Clergy"
 HLZ_concessions_clergy_desc:0 "The priests have been crucial in making feudalism salonfähig once again in Holzbrenn. We should seek to repay the favour."
 HLZ_relegitimization_dialogue:0 "Relegitimization through Dialogue"
 HLZ_relegitimization_dialogue_desc:0 "Our people's worries come not from blind hatred towards the nobility, but from legitimate concerns of another Kaspar Rosenblut rising to the throne. By talking to the common populace, we can dispel these fears and restore trust in the system."
 HLZ_acknowledge_complicity:0 "Acknowledge Complicity"
 HLZ_acknowledge_complicity_desc:0 "Rosenblut came from our own ranks, and we did not act to oust him as early as we could have. There is blood on our hands, and by issuing an official acknowledgement of guilt and an apology, we could make large strides towards mending the rift in our society."
 HLZ_concessions_peasantry:0 "Concessions to the Peasantry"
 HLZ_concessions_peasantry_desc:0 "The farmers, serfs and other peasants suffered by far the most from Rosenblut's excesses. They deserve reparations for what the Mad Freiprinz did to them."
 HLZ_relegitimization_results:0 "Relegitimization through Results"
 HLZ_relegitimization_results_desc:0 "Even the most ardent opponent of the government can be pacified by putting food in his belly and money in his pocket. By building a strong economy, we can show our people we are right to be in charge."
 HLZ_share_wealth:0 "Share our Wealth"
 HLZ_share_wealth_desc:0 "Bringing wealth to Holzbrenn will not do us any good unless we make sure even the poorest of society can benefit from it We must make sure our economy works for everyone, not just the nobility."
 HLZ_concessions_bourgeoisie:0 "Concessions to the Bourgeoisie"
 HLZ_concessions_bourgeoisie_desc:0 "The merchant class is the main driver of our prosperity, and we should make sure they have all the instruments they need to continue bringing wealth to our Freiprinztum."
 HLZ_aristocracy_accepted:0 "Aristocracy Accepted"
 HLZ_aristocracy_accepted_desc:0 "It has taken much work, and some people will simply never be on our side, but we finally enjoy support from the common people once again. The Seven save the Freiprinz!"
 HLZ_repairing_image:0 "Repairing our Image"
 HLZ_repairing_image_desc:0 "The reign of the Mad Freiprinz has not been good for our standing in the Union; what few diplomats paid homage to other Freiprinzen were usually inept cronies, and Rosenblut himself has racked up quite the list of diplomatic insults, and that's ignoring his heretical dabblings in sorcery. We must begin to regain our diplomatic footing at once."
 HLZ_socialite_prince:0 "The Socialite Prince"
 HLZ_socialite_prince_desc:0 "Freiprinz Beckenbauer is already rather charismatic, and his reputation as a socialite is well-known throughout the land. Several invitations to balls, receptions and other social events have already been extended, and this would be an excellent opportunity to increase our standing in the eyes of the Union's upper crust."
 HLZ_exploit_dynastic_ties:0 "Exploit Dynastic Ties"
 HLZ_exploit_dynastic_ties_desc:0 "Many of the nobles in our government have extended family ties in foreign courts. By reaching out to these family members, we can gain a foothold in estranged courts and begin to reverse the damage Rosenblut did to our reputation."
 HLZ_found_beziehungsburo:0 "Found the Beziehungsburö"
 HLZ_found_beziehungsburo_desc:0 "The old system of relying on throwing whatever noble we happen to have lying around at foreign courts and hope good relations come out of it no longer works. We need to set up a formal Bureau of Relations to manage our diplomatic efforts."
 HLZ_edlerrat:0 "The Edlerrat"
 HLZ_edlerrat_desc:0 "The Council of Dukes has now solidified its control of the Freiprinztum, but there are still problems that need to be dealt with. Primarily, we need to tackle the anti-Elven sentiments among our Human population, and we need to shore up popular support."
 HLZ_equality_act:0 "Pass the Equality Act"
 HLZ_equality_act_desc:0 "Despite having ousted Rosenblut's regime, his mark still lingers on much of our legislation, barring non-Humans from owning land, prohibiting them from occupying high positions, and other Puritan nonsense. It is time we lift these restrictions on our people, so all can stand equal under the Crown."
 HLZ_talk_libertines:0 "Talk with the Libertines"
 HLZ_talk_libertines_desc:0 "Several voices on the Council have raised in favour of reaching out to the Libertines, and perhaps even allowing them a seat or two at the Council, despite not being nobility. After all, they represent a large portion of our people, and deserve to be heard."
 HLZ_constitution_noble:0 "The Noble Constitution"
 HLZ_constitution_noble_desc:0 "The Libertine delegation at the Council has suggested codifying our new freedoms into a constitution. This seems like a good addition to our other safeguards."
 HLZ_talk_league:0 "Talk with the League"
 HLZ_talk_league_desc:0 "Despite being opposed to the nobility in general and the Freiprinz in particular, the leader of the Solidarity League have let us know they would be interested in negotiations. Perhaps we should listen; after all, they represent the working class, the backbone of our country."
 HLZ_introduce_welfare:0 "Introduce Welfare"
 HLZ_introduce_welfare_desc:0 "The Rosite delegation at the Council proposed an expansion of our various social programs into a social safety net of sorts, that would guarantee that no one would go hungry or homeless. Many nobles regard this idea positively, even though it would be a great financial burden on them."
 HLZ_elven_representation:0 "Elven Representation"
 HLZ_elven_representation_desc:0 "Thanks to Rosenblut's vile rhetoric, Elf-Human relations in Holzbrenn are at an all-time low. We must grant the Elven community a representative on the Edlerrat in order to rebuild unity in our society."
 HLZ_enlightened_nobility:0 "Enlightened Nobility"
 HLZ_enlightened_nobility_desc:0 "In our Principality, the nobility and the commoners stand side by side, both working together to secure a brighter future for each other. Old prejudices have fallen away, and a new age of unity has dawned. Our noble-commoner relations are the envy of the Union!"
 HLZ_idyllischen_prinztum:0 "Idyllischen Prinztum"
 HLZ_idyllischen_prinztum_desc:0 "In our country, there is no oppression of the peasants by the nobles, but co-operation. There is no fear of the aristocrats in the hearts of the lower classes, but respect as equals. Ours is an idyllic Princedom, now and forever more!"

 HLZ_soft_power:0 "Soft Power"
 HLZ_soft_power_desc:0 "Pressler is reliant on the support of the nobility, as his own cash reserves are rapidly shrinking. By ostracizing him from Ungerdaler court life, we can put an end to his scheming without spilling a drop of blood."
 HLZ_request_excommunication:0 "Request Excommunication"
 HLZ_request_excommunication_desc:0 "The Church of the Seven is one of the most influential institutions in the Union, and more importantly, their power isn't limited by borders of the Freiprinztümer. If we get Pressler excommunicated, it will severely limit his ability to organize a counter-revolution."
 HLZ_push_banishment:0 "Push for Banishment"
 HLZ_push_banishment_desc:0 "Pressler is trying to organize his army of rabble-rousers and build up a reputation as legitimate claimant to the throne. If he were to be banished, it would undermine both his image and his ability to organize an army."
 HLZ_no_rest_wicked:0 "No Rest for the Wicked"
 HLZ_no_rest_wicked_desc:0 "No matter what court Pressler runs to, no matter what he tries to do, we shall hinder his every step. We shall see to it that every door is slammed in his face, that every noble will turn him away, that every mercenary he approaches spits on his offers. He shall have no allies in this world."
 HLZ_hard_power:0 "Hard Power"
 HLZ_hard_power_desc:0 "A deceased conspirator cannot seize power. We will hunt down Pressler's clique and put them to the sword."
 HLZ_bounty:0 "Put a Price on Pressler's Head"
 HLZ_bounty_desc:0 "Coin is an excellent motivator, and many adventurers and mercenaries are happy to take up bounty hunting if the pay is right. Let it be known we will reward anyone who brings us Pressler's head handsomely."
 HLZ_military_hunt:0 "Punitive Expedition"
 HLZ_military_hunt_desc:0 "Pressler poses an existential threat to the Freiprinztum of Holzbrenn, and thus we are well within our rights to launch a punitive expedition against anyone who hosts him. Assemble a company to send after him."

 HLZ_relentless_hunt_desc:0 "We shall hunt Pressler in the Realm, we shall hunt him on the seas and oceans, we shall hunt with growing confidence and growing strength in the Union, we shall defend our Freiprinztum, whatever the cost may be. We shall hunt him on the beaches, we shall hunt him in the cities, we shall hunt him in the fields and in the streets, we shall hunt him in the hills; we shall never relent."
 HLZ_kirschenrevolution:0 "Die Kirschenrevolution"
 HLZ_kirschenrevolution_desc:0 "The 'Cherry Revolution', so titled by it being started by the workers in the cherry pickers, has amassed a great throng of peasants, craftsmen and deserting soldiers. The Mad Prince and what little followers he has left have been sent packing, and the people of Holzbrenn are at long last masters of their own fate!"
 HLZ_assembly_libertine:0 "The Libertine Assembly"
 HLZ_bauernherren:0 "The Bauernherren"
 HLZ_bauernherren_desc:0 "The Bauernherren, or 'Gentlemen Farmers', have rapidly become a force to be reckoned with, buying up land that has been unused since Rosenblut's policies and the famine drove many of our people away. We will have to consider their impact on our society and respond accordingly."
 HLZ_support_bauernherren:0 "Support the Bauernherren"
 HLZ_support_bauernherren_desc:0 "The Bauernherren are the victors in the competition of our economy, and therefore are the best and brightest Holzbrenn has to offer. We should support them, so that they may bring ever greater riches to our Freiprinztum."
 HLZ_efficiency_scale:0 "Efficiency through Scale"
 HLZ_efficiency_scale_desc:0 "The size of the Bauernherren's estates allows them to make more productive use of plows and other means of production, as well as assign people to specific tasks, rather than a few people constantly having to switch between the type of work they do. This has led to increased efficiency on the farm."
 HLZ_machen_lassen:0 "Machen-Lassen"
 HLZ_machen_lassen_desc:0 "We have seen the rise of wealthy Bauernherren in some areas, and Smallholders enduring in others. We should let economics take their natural course, and not interfere in the developments the market brings."
 HLZ_efficiency_competition:0 "Efficiency through Competition"
 HLZ_efficiency_competition_desc:0 "Keeping our hands off the market has worked out splendidly - the most efficient and profitable farms and estates have risen to the top, bringing great wealth to our country!"
 HLZ_support_smallholders:0 "Support the Smallholders"
 HLZ_support_smallholders_desc:0 "Huge conglomerates of wealthy estates are not in the interests of our people. We should encourage the proliferation of smaller farmsteads instead, to make sure our people can support themselves, and not have to rely on a wealthy Bauernherr for their livelihoods."
 HLZ_efficiency_interests:0 "Efficiency through Personal Interests"
 HLZ_efficiency_interests_desc:0 "A farmer with a personal interest in crops he grows and the livestock he raises will take far better care of them than one who is paid by the day to look after them. By making sure our people have a personal investment in their farmsteads, we will see productivity rise."
 HLZ_big_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks for the Big"
 HLZ_big_breaks_desc:0 "The estates of the Bauernherren have proven to be economic powerhouses. We should reduce the burden of taxation on them, so that they can re-invest even more into their farm, and bring even more prosperity to the people of Holzbrenn!"
 HLZ_small_subsidies:0 "Subsidies for the Small"
 HLZ_small_subsidies_desc:0 "The farms of the Smallholders may not make any individual particularly rich, but they mean our people are all secure in a livelihood. We should provide support to those Smallholders that are currently struggling, to prevent them from going under."
 HLZ_agricultural_boom:0 "Agricultural Boom"
 HLZ_agricultural_boom_desc:0 "The memories of famine are consigned to history, and rapidly fading - Holzbrenner farmers are reporting record intakes, and even the poorer folk can afford to consistently eat three meals a day, sometimes even having the luxury of eating meat!"
 HLZ_assembly_libertine_desc:0 "The people have voted, and the Libertine faction has gained the most seats in the new Citizen's Assembly! Their promises of freedom and commerce have swayed the many carpenters and merchants Holzbrenn is home to."
 HLZ_guarantee_freedoms:0 "Guarantee Freedoms"
 HLZ_guarantee_freedoms_desc:0 "We have won the confidence of the people by promising them freedoms that were unthinkable during Rosenblut's tyranny. As such, our first act in government must be writing these freedoms into law."

 HLZ_support_carpenters_desc:0 "The Carpenter's Guild was crucial in the success of the Cherry Revolution, and they are one of the most powerful factions backing the government. They should have our full support."
 HLZ_create_beratungsrat:0 "Create the Beratungsrat"
 HLZ_create_beratungsrat_desc:0 "While we of course support our merchants in their commercial endeavours, we admit the League has a point when they cite the injustices inflicted on the workers by their employer. As such, let us create a Negotiation Council, where employers and employees can negotiate the terms of employment and create a compromise that suits both. Co-operation will surely bring prosperity to all."
 HLZ_constitution_libertine:0 "The Libertine Constitution"
 HLZ_constitution_libertine_desc:0 "Though we have already written a great many freedoms into law, this is done in seperate documents, all referencing each other. The end result is a mess of paperwork and a legislative nightmare. Let us rewrite all these scattered acts, bills and ordinances into one great Constitution, to guarantee the freedom of every Holzbrenner forever!"
 HLZ_co_government:0 "Co-Government"
 HLZ_co_government_desc:0 "Though two factions have emerged as the biggest following the elections - the Libertines and the Solidarity League - neither can govern alone. As such, a compromise must be worked out between the two, so that we can form a co-government."
 HLZ_feed_poor:0 "Feed the Poor"
 HLZ_feed_poor_desc:0 "While the Libertines and the League are divided on the issue of land redistribution, both agree that the famine currently sweeping the country has to be dealt with immediately. We have passed several bills setting up soup kitchens throughout the country and funding relief efforts. Our people cry out for bread, and we shall give it to them."
 HLZ_state_sponsored_hospitals:0 "State-Sponsored Hospitals"
 HLZ_state_sponsored_hospitals_desc:0 "Historically, plagues have been devastating to our country, as there is little infrastructure to deal with them. We must remedy this by funding several hospitals across the country, so that we will never again suffer from massive epidemics."
 HLZ_freigilde:0 "Establish Freigilde"
 HLZ_freigilde_desc:0 "Though the existing Guilds were one of the motors of the revolution, allowing for co-ordination and planning of the uprising on a national level, they are very stratified institutions, denying the poor social mobility. The Libertines and the League have agreed to establish so-called 'Freeguilds', where anyone is welcome, regardless of their birth, station or wealth."
 HLZ_prosperous_state:0 "The Prosperous State"
 HLZ_prosperous_state_desc:0 "Here in Holzbrenn, we have built a state where anyone, regardless of race or birth, can make their fortune. Our state is prosperous, and all our citizens share in its wealth!"

 HLZ_ordorian_refugees:0 "Welcome Ordorian Refugees"
 HLZ_ordorian_refugees_desc:0 "Both the League and the Libertines share a concern over the plight of Ordoria's citizens. Let it be known that any Ordorian who feels alienated by their current government is welcome to settle in Holzbrenn. They deserve freedom from oppression as much as we do."
 HLZ_aid_rthauiaur:0 "Aid Rthauiaur"
 HLZ_aid_rthauiaur_desc:0 "Our friends in Rthauiaur live in the shadow of the Ordorian tyrants - just as we gained our freedom here, so must we aid in defending the Revolution in Rthauiaur!"
 HLZ_defensive_stratagems:0 "Defensive Stratagems"
 HLZ_defensive_stratagems_desc:0 "It is clear that we will be at war with Ordoria in the near future. We will have to prepare our border forts and devise strategies in anticipation of Elven armies marching on Holzbrenn."
 HLZ_equal_rights:0 "Equal Rights"
 HLZ_equal_rights_desc:0 "Though Rosenblut and his cronies have long since been kicked out of the country, they have left a stain of discrimination on our legal framework and our culture. Though we cannot shift our people's mindset in a day, we can take a first step by formally repealing all discriminatory laws and replacing them with a bill guaranteeing equal rights."
 HLZ_anti_discrimination_campaigns:0 "Anti-Discrimination Campaigns"
 HLZ_anti_discrimination_campaigns_desc:0 "Though we have passed laws guaranteeing equality on paper, practice shows that Rosenblut's poisonous bigotry still infects our people. We have decided to start a propaganda campaign to combat such hateful sentiments."
 HLZ_anti_corruption_measures:0 "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 HLZ_anti_corruption_measures_desc:0 "Though they have different arguments for the conclusion, both the Libertines and the League agree that we have to deal with the corruption that flourished under Rosenblut's regime. To this end, let us pass several laws protecting those who report corrupt officials, as well as institute a scrutinizing body for the government."
 HLZ_just_state:0 "The Just State"
 HLZ_just_state_desc:0 "Holzbrenn has become a bastion of justice in a world marred by greed and corruption. Our people trust each other, and the rule of law is stronger than it has ever been!"
 HLZ_it_can_work:0 "It Can Work"
 HLZ_it_can_work_desc:0 "Though cynics on all sides claimed that our co-government would fall to infighting and petty squabbles, their doomsaying has proven wrong. The government is stronger and more respected than ever - we have shown the world that negotiation and compromise can triumph over violence and tyranny."
 HLZ_fate_aristocracy:0 "The Fate of the Aristocracy"
 HLZ_fate_aristocracy_desc:0 "Though a sizeable portion of the nobility has fled along with Rosenblut, the majority has remained behind, still claiming authority by birthright. We will have to decide how to deal with them."
 HLZ_assembly_rosite:0 "The Rosite Assembly"
 HLZ_assembly_rosite_desc:0 "The votes have been counted, and the Solidarity League has gained the most seats in the new Citizen's Assembly! Their promises of land redistribution and support for the worker have convinced the peasants and lumberjacks of Holzbrenn."
 HLZ_never_another_starving_man:0 "Never Another Starving Man"
 HLZ_never_another_starving_man_desc:0 "Though we are already forming an emergency plan with the Libertines to deal with the immediate famine in the country, we must pass some bills supporting land redistribution so that in the future, large swathes of land shall not go uncultivated by nobles who have more acres than they know what to do with, while unemployed peasants go hungry. Nevermore shall a person starve in Holzbrenn!"
 HLZ_anti_illiteracy_programs:0 "Anti-Illiteracy Programs"
 HLZ_anti_illiteracy_programs_desc:0 "Though most of the middle class and practically all of the former nobility can read and write, literacy among the workers is still very limited. Let us institute literacy programs, so that no man will ever be dependent on another to understand vital documents!"
 HLZ_staatshauser:0 "Staatshäuser"
 HLZ_staatshauser_desc:0 "Our people live in severely inadequate houses, and many in the rural areas don't even have any place to call home at all. This situation must end. We will initiate a program of 'State Houses', building houses for our poorer citizens and tie the rent to their income. This way, anyone will be able to afford a roof over their head."
 HLZ_constitution_popular:0 "The Popular Constitution"
 HLZ_constitution_popular_desc:0 "Though we have already written a great many rights into law, this is done in seperate documents, all referencing each other. The end result is a mess of paperwork and a legislative nightmare. Let us rewrite all these scattered acts, bills and ordinances into one great Constitution, to guarantee the rights of every Holzbrenner forever!"
 HLZ_begin_land_reform:0 "Initiate Land Reform"
 HLZ_begin_land_reform_desc:0 "One of our major electoral promises was the matter of land reform. During Rosenblut's reign, many of our people died or left the country, resulting in a few people ending up with most of the land, leaving them rich at the expense of many others. This injustice cannot stand."
 HLZ_republican_farms:0 "Republikanische Bauernhöfe"
 HLZ_republican_farms_desc:0 "The government is run by the people, and the people must run the farms. Ergo, the farms must be operated by the government. This will ensure that the produce and profits go to benefit the people, rather than line the pockets of the rich."
 HLZ_state_deputies:0 "Abgeordnete des Staates"
 HLZ_state_deputies_desc:0 "Though we can broadly steer the running of large farms from the capital, messengers take time to bring news to us and bring orders back to the farms. In order to react more quickly to local crises as well as provide closer oversight, we will have the farmers elect local Deputies of State to act as the local governmental representative. Subject to approval by the government, of course."
 HLZ_encourage_communalization:0 "Encourage Communalization"
 HLZ_encourage_communalization_desc:0 "Those that work the land know best what the land needs. Rather than enforce a solution from above, we should promote communal farming by local farmers instead."
 HLZ_communal_tax:0 "Communal Tax"
 HLZ_communal_tax_desc:0 "More and more of our farmers have pooled their resources, but our tax system is still built around the individual. We will have to reform taxation and introduce a tax on communal farms."
 HLZ_mandate_smallholds:0 "Mandate Smallholds"
 HLZ_mandate_smallholds_desc:0 "Why should anyone own more land than they know what to do with? By mandating that any farm be a Smallhold, ran by an individual or a family at most, we can make sure no-one takes more than their fair share. What they grow shall be theirs, and not a kernel of grain more."
 HLZ_day_plow_rule:0 "The Day-Plow Rule"
 HLZ_day_plow_rule_desc:0 "The definition of what constitutes a 'Smallhold' is very loose, almost to the point of subjectivity. While this was good enough for a long time, our new laws require a stricter definition of the term. We shall make it so that nobody may own more land than they can plow in a single day."
 HLZ_compensate_affected:0 "Compensate the Affected"
 HLZ_compensate_affected_desc:0 "While we care not for the complaints of the wealthy that have seen their lands redistributed, we have also adversely affected some poorer farmers. It seems only fair to compensate them for the temporary damage to their livelihoods."
 HLZ_utopia_compensation:0 "Utopia as Compensation"
 HLZ_utopia_compensation_desc:0 "Though we understand the discontent of our people with some of our redistributory measures, we cannot compromise on justice. We are working towards building a paradise here in Holzbrenn, and that shall be compensation enough."
 HLZ_finish_land_reform:0 "Finish Land Reform"
 HLZ_finish_land_reform_desc:0 "We have managed to complete our ambitious program of land reform, and the successes are already evident - our people are reporting ever greater harvests, and the livestock is fatter than ever!"
 HLZ_idyllischen_republik:0 "Idyllischen Republik"
 HLZ_idyllischen_republik_desc:0 "Our republic is the envy of the Union, with debates, negotiations and reasoning taking precedence over displays of power and violence in all levels of society. The spirit of freedom burns strong in every Holzbrenners' heart - never again shall a tyrant impose their will on our Republic!"
 HLZ_end_madness:0 "End the Madness"
 HLZ_end_madness_desc:0 "Even though our government has long since expelled the tyrannical House Rosenblut and his influence on our laws, his toxic ideas had already seeped into our people by the time the Mad Prince was ousted. It has thus far proven difficult to purge such twisted sentiments from our culture, but with one last push, we are confident we can cleanse our country of Rosenblut's twisted ideals!"
 HLZ_princely_army_recovery:0 "Regain our Lost Military Glory"
 HLZ_princely_army_recovery_desc:0 "During the heydays of the Freiprinztum under Edmund the Good, Holzbrenn's army was respected by our allies and feared by our enemies. Drilled to perfection and equipped with the finest arms and armour our blacksmiths could provide, its greatness now naught but a memory, tarnished by Kaspar's corruption of our once proud forces. We will have to intitiate extensive programs to rebuild our might."
 HLZ_military_investment:0 "Light up the Forges Once More"
 HLZ_military_investment_desc:0 "Let the flames of our forge burn bright! When our country suffered under the yoke of the Mad Freiprinz, many of our smiths departed to greener pastures, and most of our forges were shut down, crippling our military industry. Through a momentous effort, we can rebuild our decrepit forges and arm our troops once more."
 HLZ_prospect_for_resources:0 "Prospect for Iron"
 HLZ_prospect_for_resources_desc:0 "The forests of Holzbrenn provide us with plenty of fuel for the forges, but importing iron in the amounts we need for our rearmament programmes is prohibitively expensive. We will have to open up mines of our own."
 HLZ_artillery_resources:0 "Fine-Tune the Kanonenlegierung"
 HLZ_artillery_resources_desc:0 "Though simple steel will do for swords, halberds and even arquebuses, the newly-developed cannons require special alloys, forged with very unforgiving coal-to-steel ratios. Through trial by error, we will have to find the perfect alloy for our cannons."
 HLZ_artillery_improvements:0 "The Holzbrenner Cannon Foundries"
 HLZ_artillery_improvements_desc:0 "With the techniques of forging the Cannon's Alloy firmly in our grasp, it is time to being mass-production of these fearsome siege weapons. Let us open a Cannon Foundry in the city, to provide our army with all the heavy firepower it needs."
 HLZ_industrial_development:0 "Request Support from the Hochprinztum"
 HLZ_industrial_development_desc:0 "While we are sure to eventually get back on our feet in due time, Ordoria's bellicose stance means we need to be ready now, not in ten years' time. We must send an envoy to the Hochprinzessin and ask her for financial support in rebuilding our military industry."
 HLZ_armed_forces_equipment_upgrade:0 "Study Stahlhof"
 HLZ_armed_forces_equipment_upgrade_desc:0 "With our basic needs in terms of armaments covered, it is time to consider making improvements to our current gear. Freiprinz Schwarzenbach has been very busy ensuring his soldiers have thee latest in military technology; we should ask him to share his secrets. We are both on the front line against Ordorian aggression, after all."
 HLZ_strategic_battleplans:0 "Kriegsplan Nord"
 HLZ_strategic_battleplans_desc:0 "With our army whipped back into shape and kitted out with proper gear once more, it is time to begin drawing up battle-plans for dealing with Ordoria. Our generals are recommending a bold strategy of limited warfare with Ordoria in order to weaken them before they launch their inevitable all-out war on the Union."
 HLZ_army_officer_recruitment:0 "Replenish the Officer Corps"
 HLZ_army_officer_recruitment_desc:0 "Under Rosenblut, our Officer Corps, once the pride of our Army, has been thoroughly corrupted, leaving only thugs and foppish yes-men in its ranks, and even these fled during the fall of Rosenblut's regime. We have to rebuild our Officer Corps practically from scratch."
 HLZ_dockyard_improvements:0 "Re-Open the Dockyards"
 HLZ_dockyard_improvements_desc:0 "Once, Holzbrenn and even smaller coastal towns like Ruhigkuste used to be hubs of trade, though now our ports lay deserted, ships rotting in the docks. We will have to change this if we are to rebuild our economy and prevent Ordoria from just waltzing into our ports uncontested."
 HLZ_coastguard_fleet:0 "Counter Ordorian Piracy"
 HLZ_coastguard_fleet_desc:0 "In recent years, Ordorian piracy has become a real problem. We have managed to avoid most of it so far by virtue of all our trading having come to a grinding halt thanks to Rosenblut, but as merchant ships seek to dock in Reichsand once more, we will have to prepare an answer to these pirating Elves."
 HLZ_freiprinz_kriegsflottenmodelle:0 "Kriegsflottenmodell Meerschild"
 HLZ_freiprinz_kriegsflottenmodelle_desc:0 "Though our new coastal defence ships are capable of seeing off Ordorian pirates, they stand little chance against a full-on invasion force. We will have to prepare heavier models of ships to defend our waters in case of war."
 HLZ_marineeinheit:0 "Meersoldaten"
 HLZ_marineeinheit_desc:0 "Though our army has always been a prestigious posting, barring during the dark times of Kaspar's reign, the Navy has never been seen as quite as respectable. We will have to change this, and we can begin by creating a specialist regiment of 'Sea Soldiers'."
 HLZ_naval_invasion_specialization:0 "Joint Naval Invasion Training"
 HLZ_naval_invasion_specialization_desc:0 "Our Marine Corps looks tough on paper, but we have yet to see how well they can handle themselves in a field excercise. By arranging a mock invasion with another Freiprinztum, we can learn more than by trying our warriors against our own methods, and share our knowledge in the process."
 HLZ_restore_the_former_glory:0 "Finish the Militärerneuerung"
 HLZ_restore_the_former_glory_desc:0 "We have rebuilt our army to its former power, and proven it in the fires of battle against the Ordorian fiend. We can truly claim that Holzbrenn's army is once again one of the finest the Union has to offer!"
 HLZ_the_fate_of_the_aristocracy:0 "The fate of the Aristocracy"
 HLZ_the_fate_of_the_aristocracy_desc:0 "With a new, Republican order in place, the rulers of old must be dealt with. The aristocrats of Holzbrenn still cling on to their titles as if they mean anything, but we know that all are born equal."
 HLZ_redden_the_blue_blood:0 "Redden the Blue Blood"
 HLZ_redden_the_blue_blood_desc:0 "While those nobles that treated their people unjustly must be dealt with, we cannot fault an aristocrat for believing in a system he was taught from birth to believe in, outdated or not. However, this does not make their ideas about society correct. We will have to educate them into proper citizens of the Republic!"
 HLZ_officers_and_diplomats:0 "Officers and Diplomats"
 HLZ_officers_and_diplomats_desc:0 "Though some nobles are completely oblivious to how the world works for the common man, being bought up at court does carry some undeniable educational perks. Many are skilled commanders, and others are gifted orators and well-versed in courtly etiquette, perfectly suitable as diplomats. We are in sore need of both."
 HLZ_exile_the_nobility:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 HLZ_exile_the_nobility_desc:0 "The nobles cannot be tolerated in our Republican society. Many have relatives in other courts, or even holdings outside of Holzbrenn. Let them go there and no longer be a thorn in our side."
 HLZ_compensation_for_losses:0 "Compensation for Losses"
 HLZ_compensation_for_losses_desc:0 "Even though it goes against our Republican ideals to let the nobles take their wealth with them - we'd rather see it go to our people instead - the reality of the situation is that many Freiprinzen are already calling for a military invasion of Holzbrenn to 'restore the natural order of things'. We will have to compensate the exiled nobility in order to appease the rest of the Union."
 HLZ_seize_the_wealth:0 "Seize the Wealth"
 HLZ_seize_the_wealth_desc:0 "The aristocracy was a parasitic institution, leeching off the wealth created by those that worked in the fields and the workshops. Their hoarded wealth shall go to benefit our people."
 HLZ_egalitarianism:0 "Egalitarianism"
 HLZ_egalitarianism_desc:0 "We have built a revolutionary society here in Holzbrenn, based on radical ideas of equality of all. Egalitarianism shall be our guiding light into the future."
 HLZ_titular_titles:0 "Titular Titles"
 HLZ_titular_titles_desc:0 "We have already stripped the nobility of their power. If their petty titles are so important to the nobility, let them keep their fancy surnames. That should placate both our homegrown nobles and the Freiprinzen abroad."

 HLZ_reassure_the_freiprinzen_desc:0 "Though our own nobility has mostly adjusted to their new social position, many Freiprinzen are still anxious, worrying that we will export our Republican ideals to their lands. Let us make sure they do not see us as a threat."

 HLZ_reintegrate_the_aristocrats_desc:0 "From the fires of Revolution, we have forged a new society, and though this has not gone without issue, we have by and large succeeded in a peaceful transition from feudal to Republican society. Let us make sure all of our nobility is on board with this."
 HLZ_new_governance:0 "New Governance"

 HLZ_zentralrepublik:0 "Zentralrepublik"
 HLZ_zentralrepublik_desc:0 "The weight of one man's vote must not be influenced by where in Holzbrenn they live! Each vote shall count equally in determining our government. As our people are concentrated in the capital, this method has earned the moniker of 'Central Republic', for its supposed privileging of the city."
 HLZ_wahlkreise:0 "Wahlkreise"
 HLZ_wahlkreise_desc:0 "Local concerns must not be left in obscurity, simply because our rural population isn't as concentrated as those in the city! By introducing electoral districts, we can make sure our people have a local connection to their representative in government, and make sure the voices of our rural citizens are not drowned out by city-folk."
 HLZ_lokalraete:0 "Lokalräte"

 HLZ_equal_opportunity:0 "Equal Opportunities"

 HLZ_ban_aristocrats_from_elections_desc:0 "Never again must the nobility be able to seize power in Holzbrenn! We will ban anyone from an aristocratic family from standing in elections, to make sure that no aristocrat shall never again hold power in their grubby little hands."
 HLZ_pressler_triumphant:0 "Pressler Triumphant"
 HLZ_pressler_triumphant_desc:0 "The rebellion has been crushed by Pressler's counter-revolution! He has proclaimed himself Freiprinz of Holzbrenn, and already has begun undoing most of the revolutionaries' reforms. The light of Revolution has been snuffed out in Holzbrenn."
 HLZ_deal_dissenters:0 "Deal with Dissenters"
 HLZ_deal_dissenters_desc:0 "Even though their organized resistance has been crushed, many of our subjects still resent our rule and long for a second revolt. We will have to crush these rebellious spirits."
 HLZ_dissent_republicans:0 "Round up Republicans"
 HLZ_dissent_republicans_desc:0 "The Republicans are among some of the worst agitators and rabble-rousers in the Freiprinztum, with their ridiculous notions of 'liberty' and 'unalienable rights'. They will have to be broken, and their organizations disbanded."
 HLZ_dissent_nobles:0 "Neuter the Nobility"
 HLZ_dissent_nobles_desc:0 "Although they were mostly quiet during Rosenblut's reign, the aristocracy was quick to denounce him once it became clear which side the pendulum would swing. They will have to be stripped of their titles and possessions and replaced by more loyal subjects."

 HLZ_conscription:0 "Reinstate Conscription"
 HLZ_conscription_desc:0 "The rebels abolished conscription for some silly utopian reason or the other. We are far less given to such harmful flights of idealism. Every body we can throw at our enemies is necessary, and therefore we will reintroduce the draft."
 HLZ_ban_arms:0 "Ban Ownership of Arms"
 HLZ_ban_arms_desc:0 "One of the biggest reasons the Revolution succeeded was that any peasant was allowed to own weapons. Though we will have to allow more rural commoners to own spears and axes, we will ban all other forms of weapon ownership."
 HLZ_iron_discipline:0 "Demand Iron Discipline"
 HLZ_iron_discipline_desc:0 "Rosenblut's generals were inexcusably lax, and this is what caused the army to defect to the rebels. We will demand the strictest obedience from our troops, to prevent further defections in the future."

 HLZ_placate_adalina:0 "Placate Adalina"
 HLZ_placate_adalina_desc:0 "The Hochprinzessin must publicly support our claim on the Holzbrenner Freithron, or else all we have done will be for naught. Significant political concessions to Adalina should sway her to support our cause."
 HLZ_our_place:0 "Our Place in the Union"
 HLZ_our_place_desc:0 "Though Adalina is the official Hochprinzessin, Schwarzenbach has been clandestinely gathering support to seize the Freithron from her and become Hochprinz himself. We will have to judge which side we back, or even stake our own claim."

 HLZ_coronation_pressler_desc:0 "With our reign secure and legitimate, and our internal opposition crushed, we can finally formalize Pressler's claim on Holzbrenn's Prinzthron in a grand ceremony!"
