 #Tribal
 
 implements_war:0 "Implements of War"
 implements_war_desc:0 "If we are to survive, we must arm ourselves. Be it with spear, axe, or club, we must stand ready to guard our homes."
 tribal_warbands:0 "Tribal Warbands"
 tribal_warbands_desc:0 "The world is dark and full of terrors. If we are to survive, we must arm ourselves and stick together to drive off whatever threats hound us in the dark, cold night."
 sparring_fields:0 "Sparring Fields"
 sparring_fields_desc:0 "By setting aside areas for our warriors to gather at and practice mock combat, they can become better fighters and learn new skills without risking life and limb. Mostly, anyway."
 war_artisans:0 "War Artisans"
 war_artisans_desc:0 "With a division of labour becoming increasingly entrenched, some of our people are dedicating themselves to crafting implements of destruction."
 advanced_leatherworking:0 "Advanced Leatherworking"
 advanced_leatherworking_desc:0 "Soaking animal hides in urine and treating it with milk of lime before pickling the hide lets us make it much stronger and more resilient. It can then be shaped into basic leather armour."
 gambesons:0 "Gambesons"
 gambesons_desc:0 "If we stuff thick woolen jackets and with scrap cloth, we can create a light protective layer that can ward off some blows without sacrifing flexibility. It can even be worn under heavier armour for additional protection and prevention of chafing!"
 brigandines:0 "Brigandines"
 brigandines_desc:0 "By sowing metal plates to a leather coat, we can create a sturdy set of armour that is still light enough to be worn by our light troops."
 alloy_creation:0 "Alloy Creation"
 alloy_creation_desc:0 "By mixing together certain metals, we can create a combined metal that is stronger than the sum of its parts. These alloys would be very useful to our warriors..."
 steel_working:0 "Steelworking"
 steel_working_desc:0 "If we heat iron up in a charcoal-fueled forge, we can create incredibly high temperatures, This creates a new alloy that is much stronger than its component parts - an excellent material for weapons!"
 fullered_blades:0 "Fullered Blades"
 fullered_blades_desc:0 "IF we hammer grooves into our blades, we can make the weapons significantly lighter without losing weapon integrity, allowing our troops to fight effectively for much longer."
 peasant_levy:0 "Peasant Levy"
 peasant_levy_desc:0 "Having our tribesmen fight is all well and good, but our enemies are sending larger and larger groups after us. We will have to force our peasants into combat in order to fill out our ranks."
 mail_hauberks:0 "Mail Hauberks"
 mail_hauberks_desc:0 "Linking metal rings together into a suit of chain mail armour is an expensive and time-consuming process, but it affords unparalleled protection to our troops. However, given the costs involved, only a select few will be able to commission such suits - the professional warrior class is born."
 improved_woodworking:0 "Improved Woodworking"
 improved_woodworking_desc:0 "Increasing knowledge of the hardness and rigidity of certain types of wood allow our bowyers to select the best, most flexible wood for bows. This should tremendously improve our people's bows, to the point we can use them for more than hunting..."
 recurve_bow:0 "Recurve Bow"
 recurve_bow_desc:0 "By making the bow's limbs curve away from the archer firing them, we can shoot arrows much farther and with a lot more power. This will allow our archers to be much more effective."
 broadhead_arrows:0 "Broadhead Arrows"
 broadhead_arrows_desc:0 "Widening the cutting edges of our arrows will let us immense trauma in anyone unfortunate enough to be hit by them. While not effective against armour, this will cause massive wounds against lightly armoured opponents."
 horseback_riding:0 "Horseback Riding"
 horseback_riding_desc:0 "Taming the horses in our lands will allow us to ride them into battle."
 mounted_warriors:0 "Mounted Warriors"
 mounted_warriors_desc:0 "Fighting on steeds has proven more difficult than expected. Those that have tamed mounts will train exclusively in mounted combat, allowing us to field them in battle."
 saddles:0 "Saddles"
 saddles_desc:0 "Remaining steady on a mount is a difficult affair. By fastening a seat to the back of the steed, we can make our mounted warriors' lives much easier."
 stirrups:0 "Stirrups"
 stirrups_desc:0 "By strapping supports to our saddles, our steeds become much easier to control and maneuver."
 cavalry_lances:0 "Cavalry Lances"
 cavalry_lances_desc:0 "By lengthening and strengthening the spears our mounted warriors wield, we can make them even more devastating on the charge."
 skirmish_tactics:0 "Skirmish Tactics"
 skirmish_tactics_desc:0 "By sending a mobile vanguard of light troops to harass the enemy before battle is well and truly joined, we can disrupt the enemy's battle plans early on."
 flanking_tactics:0 "Flanking Tactics"
 flanking_tactics_desc:0 "Our mounted warriors are fast, and have proven themselves capable of traversing great distances in the blink of an eye. We should exploit the obvious military advantages this brings."
 scouting_parties:0 "Scouting Parties"
 scouting_parties_desc:0 "When fighting our foes, it pays to know where they are before we happen onto them by chance. We should send out dedicated scouting parties to explore our surroundings, before we run into any ambushes."
 astrolabe:0 "The Astrolabe"
 astrolabe_desc:0 "By creating a miniature model of the universe, it becomes possible to calculate many useful things, including latitude. This will make our scouts much more effective."
 compass:0 "The Compass"
 compass_desc:0 "Specific metals seem to have the property of always pointing Northward. Whether this is because of the laws of physics or some arcane effect, we do not know, but it's immensely useful for finding your way around."
 cartography:0 "Cartography"
 cartography_desc:0 "Maps are great! By having our scouts sketch out rough maps of the surrounding area, and keeping a detailed stock of maps of places in our own lands, it becomes much easier to quickly find the best positions and bottlenecks for engaging the enemy."
 
 #Medieval
 
 armoured_leather:0 "Armoured Leather"
 armoured_leather_desc:0 "A natural evolution from brigandine armour, armoured leather is a step in the direction of full plate mail. By adding metal pauldrons and shinguards to the brigandine, vulnerable extremities received improved protection."
 kite_shields:0 "Kite Shields"
 kite_shields_desc:0 "Lengthy and with a tapered point downwards, these shields protect the wielder's entire body if used effectively."
 arm_straps:0 "Arm Straps"
 arm_straps_desc:0 "Holding the shield in your fist is effective, but prone to being knocked out of your hand. By strapping it to your forearm, it becomes much harder to lose your primary means of active defense."
 bucklers:0 "Bucklers"
 bucklers_desc:0 "Small, round shields meant for active defense. By holding these extended in front of themselves, the soldier wielding it projects a 'cone of defense' that makes it very easy to block incoming attacks with minimal movement. It doesn't do much against projectiles, though."
 heater_shields:0 "Heater Shields"
 heater_shields_desc:0 "A shortened version of the kite shield lacking the typical tapered point, heater shields are easier to maneuver but leave the legs exposed, requiring strong greaves or shinguards to prevent presenting a vulnerable spot."
 pavises:0 "Pavises"
 pavises_desc:0 "Often called 'tower shields' in common parlance, these massive chunks of wood and metal actually serve less as shields and more as mobile protection for archers and arbalists. By ramming the pavise into the ground, the ranged soldier gains a protective piece of concealment behind which they can reload and take cover."
 bastard_swords:0 "Bastard Swords"
 bastard_swords_desc:0 "Also called 'hand-and-a-half swords,' these weapons can be wielded with either a single hand, or both. This allows the wielder the ability to wield a shield granted by one-handed weapons while retaining the speed and power of a two-handed weapon if necessarry."
 great_helm:0 "Great Helm"
 great_helm_desc:0 "A helmet that completely encapsulates the wearer's head, the protection afforded by a great helm is unparalleled. Its only downside is that it restricts sight and hearing quite significantly."
 winged_helm:0 "Winged Helmet"
 winged_helm_desc:0 "Some of our wealthiest warriors have stuck majestic wings to the sides of their helmet. While completely impractical in combat, they tend to take leadership roles out of the direct frontline, and in this position their imposing figure greatly inspires our men - not to mention that it makes it a lot easier for our troops to spot their commanders."
 two_handed_swords:0 "Two-Handed Swords"
 two_handed_swords_desc:0 "Enormously powerful weapons that require both hands to wield, two-handed swords deal fast and devastatingly powerful blows. Though heavier than one-handed swords, the ability to leverage both hands on the hilt means that this weapon is actually faster than its one-handed cousin."
 plate_armour:0 "Plate Armour"
 plate_armour_desc:0 "Wielding a weapon in both hands leaves no room for a shield, and so armour had to evolve to both make up for the lack of shields and to take the blows of increasingly powerful weapons. Plate armour is perfectly fit to each individual and angled so that sword strikes are deflected harmlessly. Naturally, this armour is ludicrously expensive, and so only landed nobility tends to wear it."
 knights:0 "Knights"
 knights_desc:0 "Those that rule the land should, naturally, be called upon to defend it. Fortunately, given that they are usually rather wealthy from taxing their peasants, they can afford the latest in arms, armour and training, meaning they can form an elite core of heavy infantry for our army."
 commercialized_sword_schools:0 "Commercialized Sword Schools"
 commercialized_sword_schools_desc:0 "Mastering swordplay is a daunting task, and true skill can only really be achieved under the watchful eyes of a master. Across our lands, these masters are opening schools to train new swordfighters, which will result in far more experienced troops we can draw upon."
 warhammer:0 "Warhammer"
 warhammer_desc:0 "Heavy hammers designed for warfare, warhammers and mauls can shatter bone and dent plate as if it were a hot knife through butter."
 halberds:0 "Halberds"
 halberds_desc:0 "The spear is a reliable weapon for taking down cavalry, but there's always room for improvement. By attaching an axehead to one side of the spear and a hook to the other, we can allow our warriors to pull knights off their horses and punch through their plate armour with ease."
 pikemen:0 "Pikemen"
 pikemen_desc:0 "By lengthening the pole of the halberd, we can attack the enemy from an even farther distance. This allows our troops to seize the initiative in combat."
 pike_square:0 "Pike Square"
 pike_square_desc:0 "By drilling our men into quickly changing which direction they are levelling their pike at, we can make our pike formations nigh-impenetrable to cavalry maneuvring. Our pike squares shall become immovable bastions on the field!"
 knightly_orders:0 "Knightly Orders"
 knightly_orders_desc:0 "Our knights are fraternizing with each other on campaigns, and forming strong bonds among themselves. We should encourage them to formalize these bonds, in order to strengthen their fighting spirit."
 falchion:0 "Falchion"
 falchion_desc:0 "A one-edged sword with a slight curve, remeniscient of the seaxes of old, the falchion is an excellent hewing weapon that is readily available for the common populace."
 tapered_blades:0 "Tapered Blades"
 tapered_blades_desc:0 "By slowly tapering our swords into a point from the very hilt, instead of abruptly forcing the metal into a point near the very tip, we can enhance the piercing ability of our swords."
 pauldrons_spaulders:0 "Pauldrons and Spaulders"
 pauldrons_spaulders_desc:0 "The shoulders and upper arms are often very exposed in combat. By designing armour pieces specifically designed to protect these regions, we can keep our troops much safer in the heat of battle."
 diamond_cross_section:0 "Diamond Cross-Sectioned Blades"
 diamond_cross_section_desc:0 "By forging our blades to have protusions instead of fullers, we can make them much more effective stabbing weapons, allowing them to punch through armour with much greater ease."
 estoc:0 "Estoc"
 estoc_desc:0 "A sword without edges but an absurdly sharp point, the estoc is ideally suited for piercing full plate armour."
 feints:0 "Feints"
 feints_desc:0 "Sometimes, the perception of an attack can do more damage than an attack itself could. By briefly engaging the enemy, only to retreat immediately, we can throw his battlelines into disarray and hide our real attacks until it is too late."
 war_bred_steeds:0 "War-Bred Steeds"
 war_bred_steeds_desc:0 "Not all bloodlines are equal. By selecting the fiercest mounts with the most stamina and power and breeding them with each other, we can produce steeds unmatched on the battlefield."
 mounted_knights:0 "Mounted Knights"
 mounted_knights_desc:0 "Heavily armoured warriors on equally ironclad steeds. Nothing can stand in the way of these warriors."
 heavy_lance:0 "Heavy Lance"
 heavy_lance_desc:0 "The lance is the knight's best weapon, amplifying his strength on the charge. We should invest in methods to make it even more fearsome on the attack."
 high_backed_saddle:0 "High-Backed Saddle"
 high_backed_saddle_desc:0 "By producing saddles with a high-peaked back, it becomes much easier for our cavalry to remain steadily seated on their mounts."
 cavalry_charge:0 "Cavalry Charge"
 cavalry_charge_desc:0 "The majesty! The terror! The élan! Truly, a formation of heavy cavalry charging at the enemy lines is a sight to behold."
 wedge_formations:0 "Wedge Formations"
 wedge_formations_desc:0 "Cavalry is proving most effective in disrupting enemy lines. We should develop tactics to maximize their use in this regard."
 shock_tactics:0 "Shock Tactics"
 shock_tactics_desc:0 "A cavalry charge coming at you is a terrifying thing to behold, and we've already seen our enemies flee rather than face our mounted warriors head on multiple times. By developing battle-cries, leering demon faces carved into their armour, and other menacing additions, we can amplify this psychological effect and win the battle without having to strike down a single foe."
 bodkin_arrows:0 "Bodkin Arrows"
 bodkin_arrows_desc:0 "Arrows with a much narrower point will be much more effective against armoured targets. While they won't cause the horrendous bleeding injuries that their broadhead counterparts do, their ability to punch through even heavy armour more than makes up for it."
 longbow:0 "Longbow"
 longbow_desc:0 "Longer bows allow our archers to shoot their arrows much farther and with much more force. The only downside is the increased strength required to wield the weapon effectively."
 quiver:0 "Quiver"
 quiver_desc:0 "By carrying our arrows in an open-topped container worn on the back or the hip, it becomes much easier for our archers to quickly get ready for combat."
 bracers:0 "Braces"
 bracers_desc:0 "Shooting an arrow causes the bowstring to slap into our archers' lower arms. By giving them leather wristguards, we can prevent injury and allow our ranged troops to keep up a higher rate of fire."
 composite_bow:0 "Composite Bow"
 composite_bow_desc:0 "By layering different types of material into our bows, we can make them much more powerful."
 crossbow:0 "Crossbow"
 crossbow_desc:0 "A powerful weapon that can pierce pretty muchy anything."
 arbalest:0 "Arbalest"
 arbalest_desc:0 "A larger variant of the crossbow that adds significant punch to the bolts it sends flying."
 composite_crossbow:0 "Composite Crossbow"
 composite_crossbow_desc:0 "By layering different materials into the limbs of the crossbows we use, we can add significant extra strength to the weapon."
 rolling_nut_lock:0 "Rolling Nut Lock"
 rolling_nut_lock_desc:0 "Our vertical triggers are very complex mechanisms, prone to breaking. By replacing this with a rod attached to a rolling nut that pushes the string out of its locked position, we can greatly simplify the firing of our crossbows."
 standardized_gears:0 "Standardized Gears"
 standardized_gears_desc:0 "Our crossbow-makers are still very unorganized, making crossbows according to their own designs. By requiring them to produce alongside standardized schematics, we can make it much easier to wield our crossbows."
 repeating_crossbow:0 "Repeating Crossbow"
 repeating_crossbow_desc:0 "Combining the actions of spanning the bow, placing the bolt and shooting into a one-handed motion, the repeating crossbow has a far higher rate of fire in exchange for limited range and power. Dipping the bolts in poison offsets the lack of power against lightly-armoured targets."
