-Redid map
-Updated for La Resistance
-Added Stahlhof and Ungerdal focus trees. Still WIP.
-Added Bilodya and Irinthios focus trees. Still VERY WIP.
-Added beginnings of a reworked tech tree. Still VERY VERY VERY WIP.
-Added medieval models to the units, thanks to Xangelo7's unit packs! They're still shooting with swords though.
-Added custom music made by Dregorin
-Added some focus icons for Holzbrenn I forgot last time
-Removed Ordoria's "I win" button against the Union

-Added portraits for army leaders. Thanks, DMHeroes!
-Send an operative to gather intel on Kaiserreich code and used that to get "Similar Ideology" opinion bonuses to work
-Wololo'd the Arkanisturm into believing the correct religion (they're heretics now! Or, well, technically everyone *else* in the Union are heretics. Long story.)
-Fiddled with resistance percentages. Overall, occupation is now much more punishing, but claims now massively reduce unrest.
-Fixed Holzbrenn's location to be correctly on the coast.
-Cleaned up some Ordorian focus icons.
-Gave the Freiprinzen military access to each others' lands, so they could actually help each other during wars.
-Told the Freiprinzen to actually help the Union out in wars
-Added balkanization option for Ordoria. More to come once I can be bothered or find someone to help, adding countries is a slogfest.
-Made it impossible for anyone to join AI civil wars or be called into civil wars by the AI. Players can still join player civil wars.
-Added additional operatives
-Added female leaders
-Added Dwarven Mountainhome skirmishes, as well as the possibility of restoring the ancient Empire of Vergallheim
-Made it impossible to take over faction leadership
-Added empty OoB's for partitioned countries so they have units and not just take over their overlord's templates.
-Removed the consumer goods modifier penalty from Priestly Ordoria's Militarized Economy Idea to make it actually worth taking
-Added Border Skirmish events for the Dwarven nations to reclaim their land. The Bergialer can only take it if they have Puritan or Absolutist rule.
-The Bergialer Kingdom is now the Bergialer Confederation.
-Changed Dwarven party names to reflect new lore.
-Added a Balkanization option for Ordoria.
-Added the option to reform the Empire of Vergallheim and rebuild the city of Zarathum.
-God knows how many other things I forgot. This is a big one and took a long time.
